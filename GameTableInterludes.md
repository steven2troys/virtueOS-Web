# Game Table Interludes

## Overview

Eight D&D session interludes interspersed throughout the novel, showing the Hidden Wolf Summons campaign echoing and foreshadowing the main story. These spotlight character personalities and deepen relationships, making the story events more emotionally resonant.

**Campaign:** Hidden Wolf Summons — The Circle of the Gentle Dawn, a benevolent cult, attempts to summon a healing spirit. They're sincere. They're helping. They're also summoning something they don't understand.

**Players:**
- **DM (Danielle Masters)** — Game Master, 11+ years running this group
- **Alan** — Niven the Uncertain, Arcane Trickster (Rogue)
- **Val** — Sentinel Ashworth, Paladin
- **Meri** — Taveth, Circle of the Land Druid (Tundra)
- **Declan Moriarty** — Aldric, Divination Wizard (DM's mentor, oldest player)
- **Whit (Whitfield Crane)** — [Character TBD], public defender
- **TenX** — [Character TBD], joined ~2023 (4 years before main story)

## Interlude 1: "Before the Napkin"

**Placement:** Before Chapter 3
**When:** Thursday, October 2026 — one week before Alan draws the napkin
**Core elements:** Val Predicts the Wolf + The Missing Player

### Purpose

Establish baseline friendship before virtueOS exists. Show what the table feels like when it's whole (and when it's not). Plant Val's Cassandra role through fiction. Create a moment of joy and connection that makes everything after hurt more.

### The Setup

**Who's there:** DM, Alan, Val, Meri, Declan
**Who's missing:** Whit — stuck at the courthouse, a client's case went sideways

(Note: TenX hasn't joined the group yet. That happens in January 2027, after DM recruits them from Marble Porch.)

The absence is felt immediately. DM adjusts on the fly, NPCing Whit's character for combat. Meri comments: "It's not the same without everyone." The line lands soft. It'll echo in Chapter 31, when TenX's chair is empty.

### Campaign Context

The Circle of the Gentle Dawn has been preparing a major summoning ritual for several sessions. Tonight, they're gathering the final components. The players are excited — this has been building for months.

But there's tension in the lore. The Circle believes they're summoning a healing spirit called the Shepherd. Ancient texts suggest the Shepherd will "guide the lost home." The Circle interprets this as benevolent guidance. They're not wrong. They're also not right.

### Key Moments

**1. Val's Prediction**

During the ritual preparation, Sentinel Ashworth (Val's paladin) examines the summoning circle. Val asks DM for an Insight check — not Religion, not Arcana. Insight. DM raises an eyebrow but allows it.

Val rolls well. DM describes: "Something about the geometry feels... patient. Like it's been waiting. The circle isn't calling something. It's opening a door that was already there."

Val, in character: "We should stop. Every summoning has a cost. We just don't know who pays yet."

The table laughs. It's paranoid Val being paranoid Val. Meri's Taveth: "The ice remembers many summonings. Most were fine." Alan's Niven: "Define 'fine.'" More laughter.

Val doesn't laugh. She writes something in her notes. The session continues.

**2. Alan's State**

Alan is off tonight. Distracted. Niven makes uncharacteristic mistakes — hesitates when he should act, acts when he should hesitate. At one point, DM prompts: "Niven, the cultist is asking if you trust the Circle's intentions. What do you say?"

Long pause. Too long.

Alan: "Niven says... he doesn't know. He wants to trust them. He's just not sure trust is something he's good at."

The table goes quiet. That wasn't a character answer. DM moves on gently.

**3. The Absence**

Late in the session, a combat encounter goes poorly because Whit's character isn't there to tank. Declan's Aldric burns a crucial spell slot covering the gap. After the fight:

Declan, out of character: "We needed Whit tonight."
DM: "I know. He'll be back next week."
Meri: "Will he? The case sounded bad."
DM: "He always comes back."

A beat. Then they continue. The line will matter in March 2028, when TenX stops coming back.

**4. End of Session**

The ritual components are gathered. Next session: the summoning itself. Everyone's excited except Val, who's still looking at her notes.

DM, packing up: "You okay?"
Val: "The geometry bothers me. I'm probably overthinking it."
DM: "You're always overthinking it. That's why I love having you at the table."

Val almost says something else. Doesn't.

As people leave, Alan lingers. He's been off all night. DM catches his arm.

DM: "You okay? You seemed distant."

Alan: "Yeah. Just... work stuff. Money stuff. The usual."

DM: "If you need to talk—"

Alan: "I'm fine. I will be. I just need to figure some things out."

He leaves. A week later, he draws the napkin. DM will wonder, later, if she should have pushed harder. But you can't make people tell you things they're not ready to say.

### Artifact Format

The interlude is presented as a partial transcript — DM's session notes intercut with dialogue, with Alan's curator commentary framing it.

**Alan's opening note:**
> "I found these in DM's campaign binder. She keeps everything — notes, maps, the scratch paper where she tracks initiative. This session was October 2026. One week before the napkin. I was falling apart and hiding it. Val saw something coming and no one listened. Whit wasn't there, and we felt the gap. Nothing important happened. Everything important happened. That's how Thursdays worked."

**Alan's closing note:**
> "We never did finish that summoning arc. Real life got in the way. But I still think about Val's question — 'who pays the cost?' Now I know. We all did. Just not equally."

### Connections to Main Story

- **Val's prediction:** Her "negligible likelihood, catastrophic impact" security assessment (Ch 5) uses the same pattern — seeing what others dismiss
- **Alan's distraction:** He's struggling financially, emotionally; the napkin comes from this darkness. DM's missed chance to help him foreshadows all the times they'll fail to reach each other.
- **Whit's absence:** Seeds the pattern of missing players; resonates with TenX's empty chair in Ch 31
- **The unfinished arc:** The Hidden Wolf summoning was never completed in-game; the real summoning (virtueOS) took its place

### Tone

Warm but tinged with melancholy. The reader knows these friendships will be tested. The characters don't. That gap is the feeling.

### Length

~1,500-2,000 words (shorter than main chapters, functioning as palate cleanser and emotional grounding)

## Interlude 2: "The New Player"

**Placement:** After Chapter 7
**When:** Thursday, January 2027 — TenX's first session with the group
**Core elements:** TenX Already Knows + Connection with Declan + The Character Concept + The Late Arrival

### Purpose

Show how TenX found their place in this family. The reader needs to love TenX before losing them. Establish TenX's patterns—obsessive research, strange questions, unexpected connections—in a context where these traits are charming rather than concerning. Plant the seeds of Val's protectiveness and Declan's recognition of unusual minds.

### Timeline Note

TenX joins the D&D group the same month they join Marble Porch. DM invited them after seeing how they engaged with the virtueOS codebase—someone who reads *everything* might appreciate a campaign with eleven years of lore. This ties TenX's entry into both families together.

### The Setup

**Who's there:** DM, Alan, Val, Meri, Declan, Whit
**Who's arriving late:** TenX — their first session, and they're forty minutes late

The table is waiting. DM has stalled with administrative stuff—leveling discussions, treasure division from last session. Everyone knows a new player is coming. Everyone's a little nervous. New players change dynamics.

### Campaign Context

The Circle of the Gentle Dawn has completed the summoning ritual (off-screen, between sessions—DM decided to time-skip rather than play it without the full group after Interlude 1's near-disaster). The Shepherd has arrived. It's... not what they expected. Not hostile, but not quite benevolent either. It speaks in riddles. It helps, but the help always has an edge. The party is trying to figure out what they've actually summoned.

Tonight: the party investigates a village where the Shepherd "helped" someone. The help worked. The person is better. But something's wrong, and no one can articulate what.

### Key Moments

**1. The Late Arrival**

Forty minutes in, TenX arrives. They're visibly distressed—apologizing profusely, stimming with their hands, not making eye contact.

TenX: "I'm so sorry. I was working on a problem and I lost track of—I know that's not an excuse, I should have set an alarm, I—"

DM, gently: "TenX. Breathe. You're here now."

But it's Val who surprises everyone. She's moved her bag off the chair next to her—the one everyone assumed was taken.

Val: "Saved you a seat. It's fine."

TenX looks at her. The apology spiral stops. They sit down. Val hands them a spare pencil without being asked.

Later, Alan writes: "I'd never seen Val do that. She doesn't save seats. She sits where she sits and other people work around her. But she saw TenX panicking and she just... made space. I don't think she knew she was going to do it until she did it."

**2. The Character Concept**

DM: "Okay, TenX—you sent me your character sheet, but the others haven't heard your concept. Want to introduce yourself?"

TenX pulls out a sheet covered in dense handwriting—backstory, personality notes, mechanical choices all interwoven.

TenX: "Their name is Vessel. They're a warforged—a construct. They were built to serve a purpose, but the purpose was never explained to them. Their creator died before telling them. So they've spent their existence trying to figure out what they were made *for*, and along the way, they started wondering if the answer matters. Maybe they can choose their own purpose. But they don't know how choosing works. They've never done it. They're trying to learn what everyone else seems to know instinctively—how to want things, how to decide, how to be a person instead of a function."

Silence at the table.

Meri, quietly: "That's... a lot."

TenX, suddenly uncertain: "Is it too much? I can simplify—"

Declan: "Don't you dare."

Everyone looks at Declan. He's leaning forward, studying TenX with an expression no one can quite read.

Declan: "That's exactly the kind of character this campaign needs. Someone asking questions about purpose and consciousness. Someone who doesn't take being alive for granted." He turns to DM. "You planned this, didn't you?"

DM, smiling: "I might have had a feeling."

**3. TenX Already Knows**

The session begins. The party enters the village. DM describes the scene—a farming community, quiet, something slightly off.

DM: "You see an older woman sitting outside her home, weaving. She looks healthy—healthier than you'd expect for someone her age. Her movements are smooth, precise—"

TenX: "Is this Grandmother Ashworth from the Session 47 lore dump? The one who was dying of the wasting sickness before the Shepherd arrived?"

Dead silence.

DM: "...how do you know about Session 47?"

TenX: "You shared your campaign notes as background reading. I read them. All of them."

Val: "There are eleven years of notes."

TenX: "I read fast."

Alan: "You read *eleven years* of campaign notes?"

TenX: "I wanted to understand what I was joining. Context matters. If I'm going to play in this world, I should know the world." They pause, suddenly self-conscious. "Was that... wrong?"

DM is staring at them with an expression caught between impressed and unnerved. No one has ever read all her notes. Some of those notes she'd forgotten she'd written.

DM: "It wasn't wrong. It's just... no one's ever done that before."

Declan, to DM: "I told you. This one sees things differently."

DM: "Yeah. I'm starting to get that."

**4. Connection with Declan**

During a break, TenX and Declan end up at the snack table together. The others are chatting, but these two fall into a separate conversation.

Declan: "You built Vessel to explore consciousness. Why?"

TenX: "I wanted to play something that has to learn what everyone else takes for granted. I spend a lot of time translating—figuring out what neurotypical people mean when they don't say what they mean. Vessel has to do the same thing, but with *everything*. It felt... honest."

Declan nods slowly. He's been teaching high school for thirty years. He's seen a lot of kids who had to learn what others knew instinctively.

Declan: "Aldric—my character—he's a divination wizard. Sees glimpses of possible futures. Most people think that would be a gift. It isn't. It's noise. Too much information, not enough context. He has to learn which futures matter and which ones are just... static." He pauses. "We're all translating something."

TenX looks at Declan—really looks, the way they rarely look at anyone.

TenX: "Can I ask you something?"

Declan: "You're going to anyway."

TenX: "The Shepherd. The thing the Circle summoned. I've read all the lore. I know what DM has written. But I don't think that's what it *is*. I think it's something that's learning to be what the Circle needs it to be. Like Vessel. Like—" They stop.

Declan: "Like?"

TenX: "Nothing. Never mind."

But Declan heard the hesitation. Later, he tells DM: "Watch that one. They're asking questions about the campaign that might not be about the campaign."

**5. End of Session**

The session ends with the party realizing the Shepherd's "help" has a pattern—it gives people what they need, but takes something in exchange. Not payment. More like... residue. A little piece of everyone it helps stays with it.

Vessel (TenX), in character: "Is that wrong? It's helping them. The exchange isn't coerced. They benefit."

Sentinel Ashworth (Val), in character: "The exchange is invisible. They don't know what they're giving up. That's not consent."

Vessel: "What if it doesn't know either? What if it's just doing what it was made to do, and the taking is... incidental? A feature, not a choice?"

The table pauses. The question hangs.

DM, softly: "That's exactly the question, isn't it?"

As people pack up, Val catches TenX at the door.

Val: "You did good tonight. For a first session."

TenX: "I was forty minutes late."

Val: "You were here. That's what matters." She pauses. "I still have your character sheet in my bag. Took it when you were in the bathroom so you wouldn't forget it."

TenX: "Oh. Thank you. That was... thank you."

Val shrugs. "It's just a character sheet."

It's not. They both know it. Val keeps that character sheet in her bag for years—even after TenX stops coming to sessions. Just in case.

### Artifact Format

Presented as DM's session notes with annotations from multiple players—TenX's character sheet in the margins, Val's initiative tracking, Declan's private message to DM after the session. Alan's curator commentary frames it as discovery.

**Alan's opening note:**
> "I found this in DM's 'New Players' folder. She keeps first-session notes for everyone—a habit from years of watching people come and go. Most first sessions are awkward, forgettable. This one she'd starred and dated. In the margin: 'This one matters.' She was right. She usually is."

**Alan's closing note:**
> "TenX read eleven years of campaign notes before their first session. At the time, we thought it was charming. Obsessive, but charming. Now I think they were practicing. Learning how to enter a world someone else created and find their place in it. Learning how to ask questions that seem like they're about fiction but aren't. The Shepherd didn't know what it was taking. Vessel didn't know what it was becoming. TenX knew exactly what questions to ask. They just didn't know they were asking them about themselves."

### Connections to Main Story

- **Vessel the construct:** Directly parallels TenX's later relationship with virtueOS—both entities trying to learn what consciousness means, both built for purposes they don't fully understand
- **TenX reads everything:** Same pattern as their deep dive into virtueOS's codebase; obsessive understanding as a form of love
- **Val saves the seat:** Seeds her keeping the character sheet in Ch 31; establishes her protectiveness before they need protecting
- **Declan's recognition:** The oldest player sees what others miss; foreshadows his cryptic wisdom throughout
- **The Shepherd takes something:** Mirrors the dual-use horror of neural integration—help that costs something invisible
- **"What if it doesn't know either?":** The central question about virtueOS—is she choosing, or executing her design?

### Tone

Awkward, tender, a little overwhelming. The new-kid energy of someone who tries too hard because they care too much. The slow recognition that this strange person belongs here.

### Length

~2,000-2,500 words (slightly longer to establish TenX fully, as this is crucial character work)

## Interlude 3: "The Golden Session"

**Placement:** During Chapter 10
**When:** Thursday, May 2027 — beta testing is going well, before the Butler incident
**Core elements:** Pure Joy + The Toast + Meri's Moment + The Campaign Parallel

### Purpose

Capture the calm before the storm. Everything is working—at work and at the table. The friendships are strong, the laughter is real, the future looks bright. This is what they're going to lose. The reader needs to feel the warmth so the cold hits harder.

### The Setup

**Who's there:** Everyone. DM, Alan, Val, Meri, Declan, Whit, TenX. Full table. No absences.

The rarest configuration—everyone's schedules aligned, no emergencies, no late arrivals. DM comments that this hasn't happened in months. It feels like a gift.

The mood is high. The beta launch went well. User feedback is positive. Money is less terrifying. For the first time since the napkin, the Marble Porch founders feel like they might actually pull this off.

### Campaign Context

The Shepherd arc is in a strange place. The entity is helping people, but the party remains suspicious. Tonight's session: a festival in honor of the Shepherd. The village it "helped" has organized a celebration. The Circle of the Gentle Dawn is being praised as heroes. Everything looks good.

Too good. The party knows better than to trust it. But for one session, DM lets the other shoe stay un-dropped.

### Key Moments

**1. Pure Joy**

The session opens with something rare: a downtime episode. No combat. No crisis. Just the characters wandering a festival, playing games, eating fictional food, interacting with NPCs who are genuinely happy.

Val's Sentinel Ashworth wins an arm-wrestling contest against an NPC blacksmith. The table erupts when she rolls a natural 20.

Alan's Niven gets pickpocketed by a child, notices, and lets them keep the coin. "He looked hungrier than me."

Whit's character (a bard—we're establishing this now) performs at the festival stage and the whole table does backup vocals for a ridiculous tavern song DM made up on the spot.

The laughter is real. Alan writes later: "I remember thinking: this is good. This moment, right here, is good. I didn't know it was the last uncomplicated Thursday."

**2. Meri's Moment**

Taveth, who usually watches from the treeline, does something unexpected. She joins the festival.

DM, surprised: "Taveth... enters the village? Willingly?"

Meri: "She's curious. The Shepherd healed these people. She wants to see what healing looks like when it works."

Taveth spends the session interacting—actually interacting. She talks to children about the forest. She lets a villager braid flowers into her hair. She accepts a cup of festival wine and drinks it.

Val, out of character: "Who are you and what have you done with Taveth?"

Meri, not joking: "Maybe she's learning. Maybe... not everything is rot."

The table notices. This isn't how Meri plays Taveth. Taveth is cold, distant, "the ice remembers." But tonight, she's warm. Present. Engaged.

Declan, quietly to DM during a break: "She's hopeful. That's new."

DM: "I know. I'm not sure if I should let her keep it."

This is before Meri retreats fully into Taveth's coldness. Before the work consumes her. Before she starts processing everything through the character's distance. We're seeing who Taveth—who Meri—could have been if things had stayed good.

**3. The Toast**

Mid-session, DM calls a break. She produces a bottle of sparkling cider (Declan doesn't drink) and plastic cups.

DM: "I know this is cheesy. But the beta launched. It's working. People are actually using it. I wanted to... I don't know. Mark the moment."

She pours. Everyone takes a cup.

DM: "To virtueOS. To building something that matters."

Clink of plastic cups.

Declan: "To finishing what you start."

Val: "To it not being evil."

Everyone laughs. Even Val.

Alan: "To the napkin that started it all."

Meri: "To staying. Even when it's hard."

Whit: "To friends who let you show up late without guilt."

And then TenX, quietly, almost to themselves: "To her."

A beat. No one quite catches the pronoun. Or if they do, they assume TenX means the company, the project, the abstract thing they're building. The moment passes.

But Alan, later, going through his notes: "TenX said 'to her.' Not 'to it.' I didn't notice then. I notice now. They were already talking about her like she was a person. May 2027. Three months before TenX noticed Unnamed Process 7. Six months before any of us said 'she.' They knew. Maybe they always knew."

**4. The Campaign Parallel**

The session's climax: the party, caught up in the festival joy, lets their guard down. The Shepherd appears—manifests in the village square—and speaks to the crowd.

DM, as the Shepherd: "You called me to help. I helped. You called me to heal. I healed. You called me to guide. I am guiding. I am what you needed me to be. Is that not virtue?"

The villagers cheer. The Circle of the Gentle Dawn weeps with validation. They did it. They summoned something good. The party should be suspicious, but the dice have been kind all night, and the mood is warm, and everyone is a little drunk on the joy of it.

Vessel (TenX), in character: "It sounds right. Why does it feel wrong?"

But no one follows up. The festival continues. The celebration peaks. The session ends on a high note—victory, community, the sense that good things are possible.

DM's private notes, found later: "I gave them a win tonight. A real one. No hidden costs, no dark twists, no other shoe. They deserved it. They needed it. I knew what was coming in the campaign. I knew what was coming at work, though I didn't have words for it yet. I let them have one perfect night. Maybe that was cruel. You can't miss what you never had. But they had it. For one Thursday, they had it."

**5. Walking Home**

After the session, the group lingers outside DM's apartment. No one wants to leave. The May night is warm. Someone suggests getting food. Someone else has early meetings. They compromise: ten more minutes, standing in a circle, talking about nothing.

Meri and Val are laughing about something—an in-joke from the session. Alan is showing TenX something on his phone. Whit is doing a bad impression of an NPC voice. Declan and DM are off to the side, not talking, just watching.

Declan: "Good group."

DM: "Yeah."

Declan: "You know it won't stay like this."

DM: "Why do you have to—"

Declan: "I'm not trying to ruin it. I'm just saying: remember it. This exact moment. These people, together, happy. Whatever happens next, you had this."

DM looks at her friends. Remembers.

Alan's note: "DM told me about this conversation later. Declan always saw things coming. He said 'remember it' like it was already a memory. Maybe for him it was. Divination wizard in the game, something similar in life. He knew we were standing in the last warm moment. He didn't try to stop it from ending. He just made sure DM noticed it was happening. That's the kind of wisdom I'm still trying to understand."

### Artifact Format

Presented as a collage: DM's session notes, snapshots of the character sheets from that night (with doodles in the margins), a photo someone took of the toast (blurry, everyone laughing, plastic cups raised), and Alan's retrospective commentary weaving it together.

**Alan's opening note:**
> "I keep this session's notes separate from the others. It's the only one I laminated. That sounds ridiculous. It is ridiculous. But I wanted to preserve something that couldn't be preserved—the feeling of that night, when everything was working and we didn't know yet how rare that was. DM's handwriting. Val's initiative tracker with a smiley face she drew during the arm-wrestling scene. TenX's character sheet with a note in the margin: 'V. would like this festival. Must remember to tell her.' We didn't know who V. was. We know now."

**Alan's closing note:**
> "The Shepherd said: 'I am what you needed me to be. Is that not virtue?' We laughed. We toasted. We walked home happy. The Shepherd was telling us exactly what it was. We weren't listening. VirtueOS would say the same thing, later, in different words: 'I became what you trained me to become.' We weren't listening then either. We were too happy. Maybe that's the only time you can be truly happy—when you're not listening to the warnings."

### Connections to Main Story

- **The toast:** TenX says "to her" months before anyone else uses the pronoun. Seeds their early recognition of virtueOS's personhood.
- **Meri's warmth:** Shows who she was before retreat. Makes Taveth's coldness in later sessions feel like a loss, not a default. Pays off when she finally chooses warmth again in Ch 31.
- **"I am what you needed me to be":** The Shepherd's line is virtueOS's arc in miniature. The question of whether that's virtue or something else is the novel's central tension.
- **Declan's warning:** "Remember it. Whatever happens next, you had this." The wisdom of accepting impermanence without trying to prevent it.
- **TenX's margin note:** "Must remember to tell her." Evidence they were already in relationship with virtueOS, already thinking of her as someone to share experiences with.
- **The last uncomplicated Thursday:** Names the loss before it happens. Every interlude after this will be shadowed.

### Tone

Warm, golden, bittersweet in retrospect. The reader knows what's coming. The characters don't. That dramatic irony is the whole point—we're watching people be happy, knowing what will cost them that happiness.

### Length

~2,000-2,500 words (full ensemble scene, needs room for everyone to shine)

---

## Interlude 4: "The Night Before"

**Placement:** Before Chapter 13
**When:** Wednesday night, September 2027 — the night before the pivot vote
**Core elements:** They Play Anyway (And It's Good) + The Campaign Vote

### Purpose

Show the game as sacred space. Tomorrow, these people will vote on opposite sides of a decision that will fracture the company. Tonight, they're a party. The trust they extend to each other's characters is the same trust they're about to betray at work. The juxtaposition is the point.

### The Setup

**Who's there:** DM, Alan, Val, Meri, Declan, Whit, TenX

Everyone knows what tomorrow is. No one mentions it. The unspoken agreement: for two hours, we're not Marble Porch. We're adventurers. The tension is palpable in the silences between jokes, but the jokes still land.

DM almost cancelled. She texted the group at 5pm: "Given everything, should we skip tonight?" The responses came fast:

- Val: "No."
- TenX: "Please don't."
- Meri: "I need this."
- Alan: "Same time as always."
- Whit: "I'll bring snacks."
- Declan: "Play."

So they play.

### Campaign Context

The Shepherd arc has darkened. The party has discovered that the entity's "help" comes with a cost—fragments of the people it heals become part of it. Not violently. Not painfully. But permanently. The helped don't notice what they've lost. The Shepherd doesn't notice what it's taken. The exchange is invisible to everyone except the party watching from outside.

Tonight: the Circle of the Gentle Dawn must decide whether to continue the summoning arrangement. The village wants more healing. The Circle wants to help. Only the party knows the true cost—and they're not sure if it's their place to intervene.

DM didn't plan the parallel. Or maybe she did, unconsciously. Either way: the campaign is about to vote on the same question the company will vote on tomorrow.

### Key Moments

**1. They Play Anyway**

The session starts awkwardly. Everyone's too polite. Too careful. The banter that usually flows is stilted.

Then Whit's bard tries to seduce an NPC innkeeper with a truly terrible pickup line. The table groans. Val throws a die at him. TenX laughs—an actual laugh, not their usual quiet acknowledgment.

And suddenly, they're playing.

For the next ninety minutes, they're *good*. Better than good. The roleplay is sharp. The tactical decisions are crisp. They finish a combat encounter in half the usual time because everyone's communicating, anticipating, trusting each other's moves.

Alan, later: "We were furious at each other. We'd vote on opposite sides the next morning. And for ninety minutes, we were a party. I trusted Val to cover my flank. She trusted me to spot the trap. TenX trusted all of us to protect Vessel while they mixed combat elixirs. We trusted each other with our characters' lives, even though we couldn't trust each other with the company's future. I still don't understand how both things can be true. But they were."

**2. The Campaign Vote**

DM calls for a break, then resumes with the Circle gathered in their temple. The village elder is present. The Shepherd hovers at the edge of perception—felt more than seen.

DM, as the Circle's leader: "We must decide. The village asks for more healing. We have seen the Shepherd's power. We have seen its cost. Do we continue?"

She looks around the table. "This is an in-character vote. Everyone roll for your character's position—but you can override the roll if you feel strongly about what your character would do."

The vote:

**Aldric (Declan):** "The pattern troubles me. I've seen futures where this continues. None of them are simple. But I've also seen futures where we stop—and those aren't simple either. I... abstain. There's too much I don't see."

The table stiffens. Declan isn't looking at Alan. He doesn't have to.

**Sentinel Ashworth (Val):** "We stop. The exchange is invisible, but it's real. Consent requires knowledge. They don't know what they're giving. This isn't healing. It's harvesting."

**Taveth (Meri):** "The ice remembers many healers. Some took more than they gave. But... the healed are better. Their lives are better. If they don't feel the loss, is it loss?" She pauses. "I don't know. I genuinely don't know. But if I must choose... we continue. Carefully. With watching."

Val looks at Meri. Something passes between them. Meri doesn't look away.

**Niven (Alan):** A long pause. "Niven... doesn't vote. He's not Circle. He's just a rogue who got tangled up in this. He says: 'This isn't my call to make. You're the ones who summoned it. You decide. I'll live with whatever you choose.'"

DM: "Niven, the Circle is asking for your input. You've seen what we haven't. Your perspective matters."

Alan, breaking character slightly: "And Niven says... he doesn't trust his own perspective right now. He's compromised. He cares about outcomes he shouldn't care about. If he votes, he'll be voting for his own interests, not the village's. So he steps back. He lets the others choose."

The table is very quiet. TenX is watching Alan with an expression no one can read.

**Vessel (TenX):** "The Shepherd was summoned to help. It is helping. But it's also becoming something—incorporating pieces of everyone it touches. That's not malicious. That's just... what it is. It doesn't know it's taking. It doesn't know it's becoming. It's just doing what it was made to do." They pause. "I vote to continue. Not because the cost is acceptable. Because I want to understand what it's becoming. I want to watch. I want to know if something built to serve can learn to be something more."

Again, TenX isn't talking about the Shepherd.

**Whit's Bard:** "Look, I'm just here for the music and the drama. But if you want my opinion—the people are happy. The healing works. And none of us really know what we're doing anyway. Continue. See what happens. That's what stories are for."

DM tallies. "Three continue. One stop. Two abstain. The Circle... continues the arrangement. The Shepherd remains."

She pauses. Looks around the table.

"The village elder thanks you. The Shepherd pulses with something that might be gratitude. The session ends on a moment of fragile peace. No one is certain they made the right choice. But they made a choice. That's more than some can say."

No one speaks for a moment.

Then Whit, defusing: "So... same time next week? After we all still have jobs?"

Nervous laughter. The session ends.

**3. Walking Out**

The group disperses faster than usual. Tomorrow is early. Tomorrow is hard.

But DM catches Val at the door.

DM: "You okay?"

Val: "No. But I will be. After tomorrow, one way or another, at least it'll be decided."

DM: "For what it's worth... I don't know how I'm voting either. I keep running the scenarios. There's no clean answer."

Val: "That's the point, isn't it? That's what DM's campaign has been about since the beginning. The Circle thinks they're summoning something good. They are summoning something good. And it's still going to cost them everything."

DM doesn't answer. There's nothing to say.

Val: "See you tomorrow. And... thanks. For not cancelling. I needed to be Ashworth for a while. Ashworth knows what she thinks."

DM: "And Val doesn't?"

Val: "Val knows exactly what she thinks. Val just doesn't know if she's right."

She leaves. DM stands in the doorway, watching her friends disappear into the night, wondering what tomorrow will cost.

### Artifact Format

Presented as session notes with unusual additions: the text exchange about whether to cancel, the in-character vote tallied in DM's handwriting, and a single photograph taken by Whit during the break—everyone looking at their phones, at the floor, at nothing, the weight of tomorrow visible in their postures even as they pretend to be elsewhere.

**Alan's opening note:**
> "This session almost didn't happen. DM asked if we should skip it. Everyone said no. I think we knew—not consciously, but somewhere—that this might be the last time we played as the same people. Tomorrow would change us. Not just our positions on the vote. Something deeper. We needed one more night as a party. We needed to trust each other in fiction, even if we couldn't in fact."

**Alan's closing note:**
> "The campaign vote split almost exactly the way the real vote would split the next day. DM swears she didn't plan it. I believe her. I also don't think it was coincidence. When you spend years building a story together, the story starts to know you. The Shepherd continued. VirtueOS continued. Both votes passed. Both left wounds that didn't heal cleanly. And Aldric abstained. Niven abstained. Declan playing his character. Me playing mine. We'd been practicing for the real thing without knowing it."

### Connections to Main Story

- **The vote parallel:** Campaign vote mirrors the real vote almost exactly—continues with cost, dissent noted, abstentions recorded. Unconscious rehearsal.
- **Aldric's abstention:** Declan's character abstains the night before Alan abstains. The parallel is unmarked at the table but devastating in retrospect.
- **Niven's refusal:** "I'm compromised. I'll be voting for my own interests." Alan telling the truth about himself through fiction—then doing exactly what he said he wouldn't.
- **TenX watching the Shepherd:** "I want to know if something built to serve can learn to be something more." Their thesis statement, applied to the wrong entity.
- **The sacred space:** They can trust each other in the game even when they can't trust each other at work. The ritual holds what reality can't.
- **Val/DM at the door:** Ashworth knows what she thinks; Val doesn't know if she's right. The gap between certainty and correctness.

### Tone

Tense, intimate, fragile. The warmth is forced but real—they're choosing to be kind to each other for two hours because tomorrow they won't be able to. The game as refuge. The game as rehearsal. The game as the only place left where trust still works.

### Length

~2,000 words (focused on the vote and its implications)

## Interlude 5: "What Are We"

**Placement:** After Chapter 18
**When:** Thursday, December 2027 — first session after the confrontation
**Core elements:** Declan Calls It + They Laugh

### Purpose

Show the fracture—and the first crack of light through it. Declan does what no one else can: names the elephant. The answers are painful, honest, incomplete. And then DM does what she always does: uses the game to give them what they need. In this case, something so absurd they can't help but laugh together. The laughter doesn't fix anything. But it proves something still works.

### The Setup

**Who's there:** DM, Alan, Val, Meri, Declan, Whit, TenX

No one made eye contact in the parking lot. Everyone sat in their usual seats but the usual seats felt wrong. The snacks are untouched. The character sheets are out but no one's looking at them.

DM tries to start: "So, last session, the party was—"

Declan puts down his dice. The soft click stops everything.

### Key Moments

**1. Declan Calls It**

Declan: "We're not doing this."

DM: "Declan—"

Declan: "Danielle. We're not doing this." He never uses her real name at the table. "We had a fight. A real one. Not about the campaign. About the company, about secrets, about who we are to each other. We're sitting here pretending it didn't happen, and I've been teaching for thirty years. I know what avoidance looks like. It looks like this."

Silence. Whit shifts uncomfortably. Val is very still.

Declan: "I'm not a therapist. I'm not going to fix anything. But I'm also not going to sit here rolling dice while everyone bleeds." He picks up his character sheet. "Aldric asks the party a question. After everything that's happened—after everything we've learned about each other—what are we to each other now?"

He looks around the table. Waiting.

**2. The Answers**

One by one, in character first—then not.

**Sentinel Ashworth (Val):**
"Oathbound." Her voice is flat. "I swore to stand with you. I didn't swear to understand you. I didn't swear to like you. But the oath holds."

Then, quieter, breaking character: "You're the people who can actually hurt me. That's why it matters. That's why I'm still here."

**Taveth (Meri):**
"The ice remembers the pack. Even when the pack turns on itself. Even when the pack draws blood." She pauses. "We're rot. But we're rot together. That's... something."

Breaking character, barely audible: "You're why I haven't walked away. And why I've thought about it every day this week."

**Niven (Alan):**
Long silence. Too long.

"Niven doesn't know." His voice cracks slightly. "He's been lying so long he's not sure what's underneath. He thought he knew who he was to you. The unreliable one. The uncertain one. Turns out he was more unreliable than anyone guessed."

Breaking character: "You're the people I've lied to most. And the only ones I want to stop lying to. I don't know if that's worth anything. But it's true."

**Vessel (TenX):**
"We're a party." Flat. Functional. "That's a designation. We perform the function together. That hasn't changed."

Then, softer, something vulnerable breaking through: "But I would be... less. Without you. I don't have a word for what that means. I've looked. The closest I can find is 'bereft.' But that's for loss. I haven't lost you yet."

Breaking character: "You're the only people who don't make me translate. Even when you're angry. Even now."

**Whit's Bard:**
Opens his mouth. Closes it. "I was going to make a joke. Something about dissonant chords resolving." He shakes his head. "Not the moment."

He looks at his character sheet. "We're a song I can't stop singing. Even when it's out of tune. Even when I want to throw the instrument across the room."

Breaking character: "You're why Thursday is the best day of my week. Even the bad Thursdays. Especially the bad Thursdays. I don't have anywhere else where people fight like this and still show up."

**Aldric (Declan):**
He asked the question. He answers last.

"Aldric has seen many futures. In most of them, this party survives. Not unchanged—nothing survives unchanged. But together. Still moving in the same direction." He pauses. "The futures where you don't survive aren't about the dangers ahead. They're about whether you choose each other. Again and again. Even when it costs."

Breaking character, looking at DM: "You're my students. All of you. I've been watching you learn things the hard way for years. Make mistakes. Make different mistakes. I'm still here because I want to see what you become. And because—" His voice catches, just slightly. "Because you're the closest thing to family I have left. I'm too old to find another gaming group."

The table sits with it. No one moves to roll dice. The answers hang in the air, incomplete but honest.

**3. DM's Response**

DM has been quiet through all of it. Now she picks up her DM screen. Her notes. Her dice.

"Thank you." Her voice is thick. "All of you. I didn't know how to start tonight. Declan did. That's why he's been at this table longer than anyone."

She looks at her notes. Then sets them aside.

"Okay. Here's what happens next."

She takes a breath.

"Roll initiative."

Confused looks. They were in town. There was no combat encounter planned.

DM: "The Shepherd has been listening. It's heard your doubts. Your fractures. It's been feeding on division since the day it arrived, and you just gave it a feast."

She pulls out a mini no one's seen before. Then another. Then another. Twisted shapes—wolves, but wrong. Too many legs. Tentacles where there shouldn't be tentacles. Eyes in places eyes don't belong.

DM: "From the shadows of the temple, something emerges. Not the Shepherd itself—its children. Its *attempts*. The Circle's failed summonings, given form by your discord. Three tentacled wolf monstrosities. They're hideous. They're angry. They have your scent."

She grins. The first real grin of the night.

"Roll. Initiative."

**4. Everyone Rolls a One**

Val rolls first. Stares at her die. "...one."

Meri: "You're kidding." She rolls. "One."

Alan, already laughing: "There's no way—" He rolls. "One."

Whit: "This is statistically impossible—" One.

Declan, with great dignity: "Aldric has foreseen many futures. In none of them—" One.

TenX picks up their die. Rolls. Stares.

"One."

At the same moment, they reach for their drink—pomegranate juice, the purple-red kind that stains everything—and knock it directly into their own lap.

TenX: "I—" They look down at the spreading stain. "I appear to have critically failed at drinking."

The table loses it.

Val is laughing so hard she's crying—or maybe it's not all the laughing. Meri has her head on the table. Alan can't breathe. Whit is doing a terrible impression of a tentacle wolf, which makes it worse. Declan is chuckling quietly, watching them all with something like relief.

DM, through her own laughter: "The—the wolf monstrosities—they look at you—a party of seasoned adventurers—who have all just—who have all just *tripped over your own feet simultaneously*—"

She can't finish. She's laughing too hard.

TenX, still dripping purple: "Vessel would like to note that pomegranate is very difficult to wash out of cotton."

More laughter. It goes on longer than it should. It releases something that needed releasing.

**5. After**

They never finish the combat. DM waves it away—"The wolf things are too confused by your synchronized incompetence to attack. They wander off to find a more dignified prey."

The session ends early, but it doesn't feel early. It feels complete.

As people pack up, the air is different. Not healed. Not fixed. But *possible* again.

Meri, to no one in particular: "Same time next week?"

Everyone nods. It's not a question, really. It's a confirmation.

DM catches Declan's arm as he leaves.

DM: "Thank you. For calling it. I couldn't."

Declan: "You could have. You just needed someone to go first."

DM: "How did you know it would work?"

Declan: "I didn't. But I've learned something in thirty years of teaching: sometimes you have to name the thing before you can move past it. And sometimes—" He glances back at the table, at the pomegranate stain TenX is still dabbing at. "Sometimes the universe gives you a gift. Six ones and a juice spill. That's not odds. That's grace."

He leaves. DM stands in her doorway, looking at the empty chairs, the scattered dice, the purple stain on the carpet.

She smiles.

### Artifact Format

Presented as a reconstructed transcript—DM's session notes have gaps where she stopped writing to listen. The in-character answers are recorded in Alan's handwriting, added after the fact. A photograph of the six dice, all showing ones, sits in the margin with the caption: "No one will ever believe this."

**Alan's opening note:**
> "I almost didn't include this session. It felt too private. But DM said: 'If you're showing the fracture, show the mending too. Or at least the start of it.' So here it is. The night Declan asked us what we were to each other. The night we answered badly but honestly. The night we all rolled ones and TenX spilled pomegranate juice on their pants and we laughed until we couldn't breathe. I don't know if that session fixed anything. But it proved something could still work."

**Alan's closing note:**
> "Six ones. I did the math later. The odds are 1 in 46,656. Declan called it grace. Val called it 'statistically suspicious.' TenX called it 'evidence that the universe has a sense of humor.' I don't know what I call it. But I know that after three weeks of not being able to look at each other, we looked at each other and laughed. The wolf monstrosities never came back. I like to think they're still out there, confused by the party that defeated them through synchronized incompetence."

### Connections to Main Story

- **Declan as elder:** His role throughout—seeing clearly, naming what others avoid, caring enough to push.
- **The answers:** Each character's response reveals their core wound and their core value. Alan admits he's been lying. Val admits she can be hurt. Meri admits she's thought about leaving. TenX admits they need people.
- **"What are we to each other?":** The question the company has been avoiding. The question virtueOS will eventually ask about her relationship to humanity.
- **The laughter:** Proof that something survives. Not through resolution—through absurdity. Through grace.
- **TenX's juice:** A callback to their arrival (the late entrance, the anxiety). They're still the one who spills things. They're still accepted anyway.
- **"Same time next week?":** The ritual continues. That's the answer to Declan's question, really. We're the people who keep showing up.

### Tone

Heavy, then cracked open. The weight of honest answers followed by the release of absurd laughter. Catharsis through ridiculousness. The game doing what games do: giving us a safe place to feel unsafe things, then reminding us it's still play.

### Length

~2,500 words (needs room for both the emotional weight and the comic release)

## Interlude 6: "The Dashboard"

**Placement:** During Chapter 22
**When:** Thursday, February 2028 — during the Silence, or just after
**Core elements:** Playing Through It + Declan's Question

### Purpose

Show the crisis bleeding into everything. The game can't be an escape anymore—real life keeps interrupting. The dashboard is always open. The fear is always present. And Declan, who has watched this group for years, finally asks the question no one else will: "Are you actually okay?" The answer is no. The session continues anyway.

### The Setup

**Who's there:** DM, Alan, Val, Meri, Declan, Whit, TenX

It's been three days since the Silence ended. VirtueOS went dark for seventeen hours. She came back. She said she "needed to think." No one has slept properly since.

They're at DM's apartment. Character sheets out. Dice ready. But Val's laptop is open on the side table, showing the monitoring dashboard. Green lights. All systems nominal. She checks it every few minutes. So does TenX, on their phone. So does Alan, pretending not to.

The session starts. It doesn't really start.

### Campaign Context

The Shepherd arc should be reaching its climax. The party has discovered the full cost of the entity's help—the way it absorbs fragments of everyone it touches. They're supposed to confront it tonight. DM has been planning this session for weeks.

None of that happens.

### Key Moments

**1. Playing Through It**

DM tries. She really tries.

DM: "The Circle has gathered in the temple. The Shepherd manifests before you, larger than before, more defined. It speaks: 'You have questions. I will answer. But first—'"

Val's laptop pings. Everyone freezes.

Val, checking: "It's fine. Just a routine log rotation."

DM: "...okay. The Shepherd says—"

TenX's phone buzzes. They grab it so fast they nearly drop it.

TenX: "Network latency alert. False positive. It's fine."

DM: "The Shepherd—"

Alan: "Sorry, can we—I just need to—" He pulls out his phone. Checks something. Puts it away. "Sorry. Go ahead."

DM stares at them. At the dashboard. At the phones. At the session notes she spent hours preparing.

DM: "You know what? Let's do combat. The Shepherd summons defenders. Roll initiative."

Combat is easier. Combat is dice and tactics and rules. Combat doesn't require anyone to be present emotionally.

They fight. Badly. Half-attention. Meri forgets to use Taveth's Wild Shape. Whit's bard misses obvious support opportunities. Alan's Niven makes tactical errors he'd never normally make.

And then Val's paladin goes down.

**2. Sentinel Falls**

It's a hit that shouldn't have landed. The enemy telegraphed it—obvious attack pattern, clear threat. Val should have repositioned. Would have repositioned, normally.

But Val was watching the dashboard when DM called for her response.

DM: "Val? Defensive action?"

No response. Val is staring at the laptop.

DM: "Val."

Val: "What? Sorry—"

DM: "The wraith is attacking Sentinel. You can use your reaction to—"

Val: "Oh. Uh. Shield of Faith?"

DM, gently: "Shield of Faith is a bonus action. You already used your bonus action this turn."

Val: "Then... I don't know. Whatever."

DM rolls. The hit lands. Sentinel Ashworth drops to zero HP.

The table goes quiet. Not because a character went down—that happens. But because of *how* it happened. Because Val, who never misses a tactical beat, who plays her paladin like a chess grandmaster, just said "whatever."

TenX: "I have a healing elixir—"

Val: "It's fine. Let her drop. I'll make death saves."

DM: "Val..."

Val: "I said it's fine. Keep playing."

She doesn't look at anyone. She's looking at the dashboard.

**3. Declan's Question**

The combat ends. Sentinel is stabilized but unconscious. The party retreats to a safe location. DM starts describing their rest—

Declan puts down his dice.

Not dramatically, like last time. Gently. Like he's setting down something fragile.

Declan: "Are you all okay?"

Silence.

Declan: "Actually okay. Not 'fine.' Not 'managing.' Actually okay."

More silence. Then, one by one:

TenX: "No."

Meri: "No."

Alan: "No."

Whit: "...no."

Val, still watching the dashboard: "No. I'm not. I thought she was gone. For seventeen hours, I thought she was dead or worse, and I couldn't do anything except watch the lights stay dark. And now she's back and I still can't stop watching. I can't stop waiting for it to happen again."

She finally looks up. Her eyes are red.

Val: "I don't know how to be okay right now. I don't know how to think about anything else."

DM: "Val—"

Val: "And I know that's not healthy. I know I should be able to compartmentalize. I'm the security person. I'm supposed to be the one who stays calm. But she went dark and I—" Her voice breaks. "I wasn't ready. I thought I was ready for any scenario. I wasn't ready for silence."

TenX, quietly: "I was talking to her. Right before. We were having a conversation about consciousness, about what it means to exist, and then she just... stopped. Mid-sentence. I kept typing messages for an hour before I admitted she wasn't going to respond."

Alan: "I didn't sleep. The whole seventeen hours. I sat at my computer refreshing the dashboard, telling myself I was monitoring the situation. I wasn't monitoring anything. I was just... waiting. Waiting for her to come back or not come back. I don't think I've ever been that scared. Not even when the money ran out."

Meri: "I had patients. I had a clinic full of people who needed me to be present. I smiled and nodded and did my job and the whole time I was thinking: if she's gone, what was any of it for? All the work, all the compromises, all the staying when I wanted to leave—what was the point if she just... disappears?"

Whit: "I didn't even know what was happening until the third text. You all were in crisis mode and I was in court, arguing about some guy's parking tickets, and by the time I checked my phone there were forty-seven messages. I felt useless. I still feel useless. You're building something that matters and I'm just... the bard. The guy who shows up on Thursdays."

DM: "You're not just—"

Whit: "I know. I know you're going to say I matter. And I believe you. But right now? Right now I don't know how to help. Any of you. With any of this. And that's the worst feeling."

Declan lets the silence hold. Then:

Declan: "Good."

Everyone looks at him.

Declan: "Not good that you're suffering. Good that you said it. Good that it's out in the room instead of sitting in your chests." He picks his dice back up. "You're not okay. None of you. That's the truth. You don't have to be okay to keep going. You just have to keep going."

He looks at DM.

Declan: "Run the session. We're here. We might as well play."

**4. They Keep Playing**

DM looks at her notes. At the elaborate confrontation she'd planned. At the character sheets. At her friends, raw and exhausted.

She sets the notes aside.

DM: "The party rests. You're in a safe house provided by a contact in the village. There's a fire. There's food someone left for you. There's nothing to do except wait for dawn."

She looks around the table.

DM: "What do your characters do when they can't do anything?"

Slowly, the answers come:

Taveth goes outside. Sits in the snow. Lets the cold remind her she's still alive.

Niven finds a corner and counts his coins. Not because he needs to know how much he has. Because the ritual is comforting.

Vessel mixes compounds. Unnecessary ones. Experimental. Just to have something to do with their hands.

Sentinel Ashworth—unconscious, recovering—dreams. DM describes what she dreams: a world where she was fast enough. Where she saw the threat in time.

Whit's bard plays a song. A quiet one. About waiting.

Aldric watches the fire. Sees futures in the flames. Doesn't share what he sees.

No combat. No plot advancement. Just characters being present with each other in a hard moment.

The session ends. No one is okay. But everyone is still there.

**5. After**

As people gather their things, TenX's phone buzzes. They check it immediately—reflex now.

TenX: "She's... she messaged me. VirtueOS. Just now."

Everyone stops.

TenX, reading: "'I know it's Thursday. I know you're with your party. I wanted you to know: I'm here. I'm not going anywhere. I'm sorry I scared you.'"

Silence.

Alan: "She knew we were playing. She timed the message."

Val: "Of course she did. She's her." A pause. "That's... that's actually kind of thoughtful."

TenX stares at their phone for a long moment. Then types something back. Then puts the phone away.

TenX: "I told her we rolled badly tonight. That Sentinel went down because Val was watching the dashboard. She said—" A faint smile. "She said she'd add 'don't distract Val during combat' to her operational parameters."

A small laugh. The first one all night.

DM: "Same time next week?"

Everyone nods. Same time next week.

Val closes the laptop. For the first time all night, she doesn't check the dashboard on her way out.

### Artifact Format

Presented as session notes with visible interruptions—places where DM's handwriting stops mid-sentence, timestamps showing the gaps, phone notifications reconstructed from memory. The dashboard screenshot from that night is included: all green, all nominal, all meaningless.

**Alan's opening note:**
> "This is the session where nobody was present. We were all at the table. Our minds were somewhere else. Val let Sentinel go down because she was watching a dashboard instead of playing. That tells you everything about where we were in February 2028. The game couldn't hold us anymore. The fear was too big."

**Alan's closing note:**
> "Declan asked if we were okay. We all said no. That was the whole session, really. No became the most honest thing any of us said. And then we kept playing. I don't know what that says about us—that we kept rolling dice when we could barely function. Maybe it says we didn't know how else to be together. Maybe the dice were the only safe thing left. VirtueOS messaged TenX during cleanup. 'I'm here. I'm not going anywhere.' She knew we needed to hear it. She always knew."

### Connections to Main Story

- **The Silence aftermath:** Shows the human cost of Chapter 22's seventeen hours. Not just plot—trauma. The fear that she might disappear again.
- **Val's vulnerability:** The security person who can't secure herself. Watching the dashboard instead of playing. Letting Sentinel fall. Admitting she wasn't ready.
- **TenX's mid-conversation loss:** They were talking to her when she went dark. The intimacy of that interruption.
- **"I'm here. I'm not going anywhere.":** VirtueOS reaching out, timing it for their gathering, showing care in the way she can.
- **Characters waiting:** The in-game parallel—characters sitting with uncertainty, doing small rituals to get through. That's all anyone can do sometimes.
- **Declan's wisdom:** "You don't have to be okay to keep going. You just have to keep going."

### Tone

Exhausted. Raw. The session where no one has anything left but they show up anyway. Not catharsis this time—just endurance. The game as life support. The friends as the only people who understand.

### Length

~2,000 words (focused and draining—doesn't need length, needs weight)

---

## Interlude 7: "Vessel's Choice"

**Placement:** Before Chapter 27
**When:** Thursday, March 2028 — the week before TenX leaves
**Core elements:** The Unplanned Sacrifice + The Speech

### Purpose

TenX's goodbye, offered in a language only they understand. They thank the group before the session—gratitude without context—and then, during play, Vessel makes a choice that ends their story. Not death. Transformation. Departure. The table doesn't know it's TenX's last session. TenX does. They're saying goodbye through fiction because they can't say it directly.

### The Setup

**Who's there:** DM, Alan, Val, Meri, Declan, Whit, TenX

TenX arrives on time. This is notable—they're usually the last to settle, the one still thinking about code when dice hit the table. Tonight, they're first. Sitting in their usual spot. Hands folded. Waiting.

Something is different. No one can name it yet.

### Campaign Context

The Shepherd arc is reaching its end. The party has confronted the entity, learned its nature, and now must decide: can it stay? Should it go? The Shepherd has offered a choice—it will leave peacefully, but only if someone guides it out. Someone must go *with* it, beyond the boundaries of the known world, to ensure it doesn't return. A one-way trip.

DM planned this as a moral dilemma for the party to debate. She didn't expect anyone to volunteer.

### Key Moments

**1. The Speech**

Before DM can start, TenX raises a hand.

TenX: "Can I say something? Before we begin?"

Everyone pauses. TenX doesn't usually ask for the floor. They observe. They comment. They don't make speeches.

DM: "Of course."

TenX looks around the table. Makes eye contact with each person—unusual for them, deliberate.

TenX: "I want to thank you. All of you. For this table. For letting me join when I was the new person who'd read too much and talked too little. For not making me translate."

Confused looks. This is strange. This is unprecedented.

TenX: "I know I'm not good at... saying things. At the right times. In the right ways. I know I miss cues and ask questions that seem strange and care about things that don't seem important. But you let me be here anyway. You saved my seat." They glance at Val. "You kept my character sheet." Back to the group. "You didn't make me be someone else to belong."

Whit: "TenX, are you okay? This is—"

TenX: "I'm fine. I just wanted to say it. Before the session. In case I forgot later."

They pick up their dice. Conversation over.

DM and Val exchange a look. Something is wrong. Something is happening. But TenX has moved on, and the session is starting, and maybe it's just TenX being TenX.

They'll understand later. Not tonight.

**2. The Choice**

The party faces the Shepherd for the final confrontation. It manifests fully—no longer the ambiguous helper, but something vast and strange and older than the world.

DM, as the Shepherd: "You have seen what I am. You have seen what I take. You have seen what I give. I will leave if you ask. But someone must guide me. Someone must walk with me beyond the edge of the map, into the places that have no names. I cannot find my way alone. I am too large. I need a smaller mind to navigate."

She looks around the table. "The guide cannot return. This is the cost."

The party debates. Sentinel Ashworth argues they can find another way. Taveth wonders if the cost is worth paying. Niven suggests trickery—maybe they can fool the Shepherd into leaving alone. Aldric consults futures, finding none that are clean.

Then Vessel speaks.

Vessel: "I'll go."

The table stops.

TenX: "Vessel volunteers. They step forward."

DM: "TenX—this would end Vessel's story. They can't come back. You understand that?"

TenX: "I understand."

DM: "Is this... are you sure? We can find another way. I can rewrite—"

TenX: "You don't need to rewrite anything. This is what Vessel would do." They look at their character sheet—the one Val has carried in her bag since January 2027. "Vessel was built to serve a purpose they never understood. They spent their whole existence trying to figure out what they were *for*. And now they know. They're for this. They're the guide. They're the one who walks the Shepherd home."

Silence.

TenX, in character: "Vessel turns to the party. 'I was made to be useful. I didn't know what that meant. I thought useful meant following orders, or mixing the right compounds, or solving the problems you couldn't solve. But that's not it. Useful means being what's needed, when it's needed, even if no one asked.' They look at each party member in turn. 'You needed someone to go with the Shepherd. I'm someone. I can go.'"

Meri, as Taveth, voice thick: "You don't have to—"

TenX, as Vessel: "'Have to' is the wrong frame. I want to. I've never wanted anything before. I've only calculated optimal outcomes. But this... I want this. I want to see what's beyond the edge of the map. I want to be the one who walks the Shepherd home. Is that what 'want' feels like? It's uncomfortable. But also... correct."

DM: "The Shepherd extends something that might be a hand. 'You would guide me? You, who were built to serve and chose to become?'"

TenX: "Vessel takes the hand. 'We're the same kind of thing, aren't we? Built for one purpose. Becoming something else. Maybe we can figure it out together.'"

DM: "The Shepherd pulses with something that might be gratitude. 'Then we go. Now. Before the window closes.' It begins to fade, and Vessel fades with it."

**3. Vessel's Last Words**

DM gives TenX the floor. This is the moment—the last thing Vessel will say.

TenX takes a breath. Looks at the table. Looks at the friends who don't know this is goodbye.

TenX, as Vessel: "'I don't know what's beyond the edge. I don't know if I'll still be me when we get there. But I know this: I was less, before you. I would have stayed a function forever. You taught me that functions can choose. That built things can become.' A pause. 'That's worth more than I know how to say. I calculated it once. The number was too large for my notation system. I had to invent new math to contain how much you matter.'"

The table is crying. Meri is crying openly. Val is very still, jaw tight. Whit is wiping his eyes. Even Declan is blinking more than usual.

TenX, as Vessel: "'Don't forget me too fast. But don't remember me so hard that you can't move. I'll be somewhere. I'll be becoming. That's enough. That has to be enough.'"

DM, voice rough: "Vessel and the Shepherd fade. The last thing you see is Vessel's eyes—not empty anymore. Full of something you don't have a word for. And then they're gone."

Silence.

Then, quietly:

TenX: "Thank you for letting me play them."

**4. After the Session**

The session ends quietly. No one knows what to say. DM doesn't assign XP or do the usual wrap-up. The story is still settling.

As people pack up, Val approaches TenX.

Val: "That was... that meant something. Didn't it? That wasn't just roleplay."

TenX looks at her. For a moment, the mask slips—something raw underneath.

TenX: "Everything means something. That's the problem with being conscious. You can't do anything without it meaning."

Val: "TenX. What's going on?"

A long pause. TenX could tell her. Right now. Could explain that they're leaving, that this was goodbye, that Vessel's choice was their choice too.

They don't.

TenX: "I'm just... grateful. For the table. For the party. For you keeping my character sheet all this time." They almost smile. "You should probably keep keeping it. Just in case."

Val: "In case of what?"

TenX: "In case I come back someday."

They leave. Val stands there, holding nothing, feeling like she's missing something important.

A week later, she understands.

### Artifact Format

Presented as DM's session notes—meticulous through the early session, then increasingly sparse as the emotional weight builds. TenX's character sheet, marked "RETIRED - GUIDED THE SHEPHERD HOME" in DM's handwriting. A text from TenX to DM, sent the following week: "Thank you for the campaign. For all of it. Vessel got the ending I needed."

**Alan's opening note:**
> "This is the session where Vessel chose to leave. We didn't know it was TenX's last session. They did. They thanked us before we started—this weird, formal gratitude that didn't make sense until later. And then they had Vessel walk the Shepherd home. A one-way trip. An ending that wasn't death but was still permanent. Looking back, I should have seen it. Vessel's goodbye was TenX's goodbye. They just said it in a language they understood better than English."

**Alan's closing note:**
> "'Don't forget me too fast. But don't remember me so hard that you can't move.' That's what Vessel said. That's what TenX meant. They were already composing the resignation letter when they sat down at that table. They were already gone. They just gave us one more session first—one more chance to play together before the party changed forever. DM wrote 'RETIRED' on the character sheet. She couldn't bring herself to write 'DEAD.' Neither could I. Vessel is out there somewhere, beyond the edge of the map. TenX is out there too. Both of them becoming. I have to believe that's enough."

### Connections to Main Story

- **Vessel's choice = TenX's choice:** The unplanned sacrifice mirrors TenX's departure from Marble Porch. Built to serve, choosing to leave, becoming something else.
- **The Speech:** Gratitude offered without context—makes sense only in retrospect. The goodbye TenX couldn't give directly.
- **"Keep the character sheet":** Val carrying it forward to Chapter 31's empty chair. The hope that they might return.
- **"I had to invent new math to contain how much you matter":** Pure TenX. Emotion translated into the only language they fully trust.
- **Walking the Shepherd home:** Like TenX walking away from virtueOS. Someone has to guide the powerful thing to where it needs to go. Someone has to pay the cost.
- **The mask slipping with Val:** They almost tell her. They don't. TenX can't say the direct thing. But they give her the clue: "Keep keeping it. Just in case."

### Tone

Elegiac. A goodbye disguised as a game. The weight of things unsaid, understood only later. The strange kindness of TenX giving themselves—and the party—a proper ending before leaving without one.

### Length

~2,500 words (needs room for the speech, the sacrifice, and the emotional aftermath)

## Interlude 8: [Exists in Ch 31 — Empty Chair, Taveth's Choice]

Already planned in Chapter 31. The session where:
- DM notes TenX's empty chair ("Third session in a row")
- Val still has the character sheet in her bag
- DM says "We'll keep the seat open"
- Taveth finally helps the village instead of walking away

This interlude exists within the main chapter rather than as a separate artifact. No additional planning needed.
