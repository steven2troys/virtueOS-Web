## Project Overview

virtueOS - Project in early development. This is a novel writing project.

## BOOK CONCEPT
A fictional software company, "Marble Porch, LLC", determines to develop a new product: "virtueOS". This operating system drives a pair of smart augmented reality glasses that help the wearer better interpret and react to their real-life situations in a virtuous manner like the philosophical Stoic Sage. 

The novel tells this story from the POV of the main character, Alan Turing Goodenough, a programmer and AI/Stoicism enthusiast. Alan collects the artifacts generated in the pursuit of the virtueOS project in order to document it. He starts with the napkin he drew in a bar the night he got the idea for the project, and gathers everything that comes after, from brainstorming whiteboards, through budget estimates, PRDs, code reviews, beta user feedback forms, and so on -- all the way to the post-mortem meeting notes and "Lessons Learned" document. 

By revealing portions of these artifacts, and Alan's notes on them, we tell the story of the novel. 

## WRITING INSTRUCTIONS
Always use the human-prose-style skill. In addition, there will be Character DNA files for each character. When writing dialog for each character, combine the human-prose-style with instructions there to perfectly capture the voice of the character. 

When planning the outline or an individual chapter or scene, always use the verbalized-sampling technique to ensure that ideas are fresh and unexpected.

### Naming Characters
When introducing new characters, never use the surname "Chen", which has become like an em-dash: a red flag indicating LLM writing (deserved or not). Also avoid re-using any name, first or surname, that is used by any existing character. We do not want to have ambiguity between our characters in the readers' minds.

**Before naming any new character, check CharacterNames.md** — this file is the master registry of all names used in the project. Add new characters to it immediately after naming them.
