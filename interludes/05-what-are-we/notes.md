# Curator's Notes: Interlude 5

## On the Session

Three weeks of silence. Three weeks of professional emails and avoided eye contact and pretending the emergency meeting never happened.

Then Declan put down his dice and said: "We're not doing this."

That's Declan. Twenty-three years in a classroom, teaching kids to face hard questions. He wasn't going to let us hide behind fictional characters when the real people were bleeding.

## On What We Said

Everyone answered his question. What are we to each other now?

Val: "You're the people who can actually hurt me." That's the most vulnerable thing I've ever heard her say. Val, who builds walls, who runs security drills, who trusts no one completely. She admitted we're inside the perimeter.

Meri: "We're rot. But we're rot together." I didn't understand it at first. Then Susan explained it to me later, when I called Meri to apologize. Decomposition isn't death. It's transformation. Things break down so new things can grow.

TenX: "I would be less. Without you." No word for it. Just: less. The thing that exists when we're together that doesn't exist anywhere else.

And me. I said they're the people I've lied to most. The only ones I want to stop lying to.

I meant it. I'm still working on what that means in practice.

## On the Ones

Six dice. Six ones. The probability is 1 in 46,656.

Declan called it grace. I'm not sure I believe in grace, but I don't have a better word.

Here's what I know: we were sitting in the wreckage of something, all of us broken in different ways, all of us complicit in different things. And then the universe handed us the most statistically improbable shared failure imaginable.

And we laughed.

Not because it was funny. Because it was true. We'd all failed. At the same moment. In the same way. Perfectly synchronized in our incompetence.

DM said the wolf monstrosities wandered off, too confused by our synchronized failure to attack. That's her genius. She took our brokenness and made it armor. She said: even failure protects you, if you fail together.

## On Declan

He's the one who didn't join. He could have been a founder. He chose to stay in his classroom, teaching kids to think, asking uncomfortable questions from a safe distance.

He called himself a coward. I don't think that's fair. He's the one who made us face each other. He's the one who asked the question no one wanted to answer.

Maybe courage isn't always about action. Maybe sometimes it's about making space for others to act. Declan made space. We filled it with honesty. That's something.

## On What Came After

We played for two more hours. Nothing important happened in the game. Everything important had already happened around the table.

When we packed up, there were hugs. Real ones. Val hugged TenX. I still can't quite believe that happened.

We're not fixed. The fractures are still there. But fractures can heal stronger than the original bone. That's what Meri said, anyway. She's the clinical one. She would know.

## On the Odds

1 in 46,656.

I keep coming back to that number. It's so unlikely that it feels designed. Like the dice knew something we didn't. Like the table itself was intervening.

I don't believe in fate. The Stoics don't believe in fate, not exactly. They believe in *logos*—an ordering principle, a rationality that pervades the universe. Not a plan, but a pattern. Not destiny, but direction.

Maybe the dice were logos. Maybe they were just dice.

Either way, after three weeks of not being able to look at each other, we looked at each other and laughed.

That's enough. That has to be enough.

*The puzzle is not whether we can be fixed. The puzzle is whether we can be together while we're broken.*

*Six ones. One table. Still here.*
