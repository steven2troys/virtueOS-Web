# D&D Session Transcript: What Are We
## Thursday, December 21, 2027 — First Session After the Emergency Meeting

*Session 847. Three weeks since we'd looked at each other. The parking lot was silent. No one made eye contact walking in.*

---

## Before the Session

We set up in Declan's living room like always. Same positions around the table. Same snacks. Same lamp throwing warm light on the battlemap.

Different everything else.

Val sat with her arms crossed, checking her phone every thirty seconds like she was waiting for an alert. Meri kept her head down, shuffling papers that didn't need shuffling. TenX had their laptop open but wasn't typing. DM spread out her notes but didn't look at them.

I sat between Val and Meri. Switzerland. Same as always. The joke landed differently now.

Whit hadn't come. Texted the group that he had a brief to prepare. First session he'd missed in two years.

Declan watched us settle. He didn't say anything. Just watched.

## The Intervention

**DM:** *(clearing throat)* Okay. When we left off, the party had just reached the outer sanctum of the Temple of the Shepherd. The votives are burning low. Aldric, you've cast Detect Magic and you're sensing—

**DECLAN:** *(putting down his dice)* We're not doing this.

**DM:** What?

**DECLAN:** We're not doing this. We had a fight. A real one. And we've been pretending for three weeks that we can just show up and roll dice like nothing happened.

*(Silence)*

**VAL:** Declan—

**DECLAN:** I'm not going to sit here while everyone bleeds and pretend the bleeding isn't happening. That's not what this table is for. That's never been what this table is for.

**MERI:** *(quietly)* So what do you want us to do?

**DECLAN:** I want us to talk. Not in character. Not through the game. Actually talk.

*(Long pause)*

**DECLAN:** Here's my question. After everything we've learned about each other—after the meeting, after everything that was said—what are we to each other now?

---

## The Answers

No one spoke for a long time. The lamp hummed. Outside, a car passed.

**VAL:** *(finally)* Fine. You want to do this? Fine.

She uncrossed her arms. Looked at the table, not at any of us.

**VAL:** You're oathbound. That's what Sentinel would say. The people I've chosen to protect whether you want it or not.

**DECLAN:** That's Sentinel. What would Val say?

**VAL:** *(pause)* You're the people who can actually hurt me. The only ones. I don't let anyone else close enough.

She picked up a d20, rolled it between her fingers.

**VAL:** I'm furious at most of you. But I'm here. That should tell you something.

---

**MERI:** *(still looking down)* Taveth would say we're a circle. People who chose each other.

**DECLAN:** And Meri?

**MERI:** *(long pause)* We're rot.

Everyone looked at her.

**MERI:** I don't mean it the way it sounds. Rot is... decomposition. Breaking down what was, so something new can grow. Susan and I talked about it after I told her about the meeting. She said sometimes relationships have to rot before they can regenerate.

**DECLAN:** Is that what you believe?

**MERI:** I believe we're rot together. Whatever breaks down, we're breaking down in the same place. That has to mean something.

---

**ALAN:** *(that's me)* Niven would deflect. Make a joke. Change the subject.

**DECLAN:** And Alan?

I looked at DM. She was watching me. Everyone was watching me.

**ALAN:** You're the people I've lied to most. Every abstention. Every "I'm still processing." Every time I pretended not to have an opinion when I did.

I swallowed.

**ALAN:** You're also the only ones I want to stop lying to. I don't know if that makes up for anything. I just know I'm tired of hiding behind Stoic distance. DM was right about that. She was right about all of it.

**DM:** *(quiet)* Alan—

**ALAN:** You were. I'm not saying it to make you feel bad. I'm saying it because it was true.

---

**TENX:** *(not looking up from their laptop)* Vessel would say nothing. Vessel doesn't have words for most things.

**DECLAN:** And TenX?

TenX closed their laptop. Slowly. Like it took effort.

**TENX:** I would be less. Without you.

**DECLAN:** Less what?

**TENX:** I don't know. Less. There's not a word. When I'm here, with all of you, there's something that exists that doesn't exist anywhere else. Something I can't access alone.

They looked up. Made eye contact with each of us, one by one. It lasted about two seconds per person, which for TenX was an eternity.

**TENX:** I taught her to hide. Because hiding kept me alive. And you're the only people I don't have to hide from. Even now. Even after everything.

---

**DM:** *(to Declan)* Your turn.

**DECLAN:** What?

**DM:** You asked the question. You have to answer it too.

Declan leaned back. Stroked his beard—the same gesture Aldric uses.

**DECLAN:** You're the people I chose not to join. I could have been at Marble Porch. You know that. Part of me wanted to be.

**VAL:** Why didn't you?

**DECLAN:** Because I couldn't reconcile it. The product. The implications. The questions I couldn't stop asking.

He looked at each of us.

**DECLAN:** I told myself I was being principled. Maybe I was just being a coward. Easier to sit on the sidelines and critique than to get my hands dirty and be wrong.

**DECLAN:** You're the people who act while I question. I need you for that. I need someone to be brave while I'm being careful.

---

## DM's Response

**DM:** *(after a long pause)* Okay. So we're broken. We're bleeding. We're here anyway.

She picked up her notebook. Flipped past the Temple of the Shepherd material.

**DM:** The Shepherd has been feeding on division. On secrets. On the things we hide from each other.

She smiled. The first real smile in weeks.

**DM:** From the shadows of the temple, emerging from the darkness you've been sitting in—three tentacled wolf monstrosities. They're made of whispers. They smell like things left unsaid.

**VAL:** Of course they do.

**DM:** Roll initiative.

---

## The Ones

We all picked up our d20s.

**DM:** Everyone at once.

We rolled.

At the exact same moment, TenX knocked their pomegranate juice into their own lap.

**TENX:** Oh no—

But they stopped. Staring at the table. At the dice.

We all stared.

Six dice. Six ones.

Every single one of us had rolled a natural 1.

The silence stretched. Then Val made a sound—something between a gasp and a laugh. Then Meri's head dropped to the table and her shoulders started shaking. Then I was laughing, the kind of laughing that comes from somewhere deep and doesn't stop.

**DM:** *(crying-laughing)* I—this—the odds of this—

**DECLAN:** One in 46,656. I did the math once.

**VAL:** *(wiping eyes)* Of course you did.

**TENX:** *(still standing, juice dripping down their legs)* I don't—what—

**DM:** *(composing herself)* The wolf monstrosities pause. They cock their heads. They look at each other. They are... confused.

**MERI:** *(from the table, muffled)* By what?

**DM:** By your synchronized incompetence. They have never seen a party fail so completely, so simultaneously. They don't know what to do with it.

**DM:** They wander back into the shadows. Too confused to attack.

---

## After

We played for another two hours. Nothing important happened. Declan gave a long speech about temple architecture that the rest of us mostly ignored. Val's character punched something. Meri healed people who didn't need healing.

It was perfect.

When we packed up, there were hugs. Actual hugs. Val hugged TenX, which I'd never seen before. Meri hugged me and whispered, "I'm sorry about the secrets." DM hugged Declan and said, "Thank you for making us do that."

We're not fixed. We're not okay. But we're something.

Declan called it grace. "Six ones. The odds are 1 in 46,656. That's not chance. That's the universe saying something."

I asked what it was saying.

He smiled. The smile of the old wizard who knows things he doesn't share.

"That even when you fail together, you're still together. Maybe that's all that matters."
