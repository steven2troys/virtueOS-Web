### Session Notes

**Start Time:** 7:32 PM (late start — everyone lingering, not quite ready to begin)

**Attendance:** Full table. DM, Alan, Val, Meri, Declan, Whit, TenX.

---

#### Opening

Awkward. Everyone too polite. The usual cross-talk and jokes feel forced. Meri asks about initiative order from last session. Val recites it from memory. No one laughs at the fact that Val remembers initiative orders.

Started with a recap. The Circle has gathered in the temple. The village needs healing. The Shepherd waits.

**Note to self:** *The tension at the table is suffocating. They all know what tomorrow is. No one will say it.*

---

#### The Break

Twenty minutes in. Combat encounter with lesser summoned creatures. Half-hearted. Val didn't even use Sentinel's reaction ability on an obvious opportunity attack.

Then Whit, during the post-combat loot description:

**WHIT (as Korvath):** "I approach the innkeeper and say: 'I've been watching you all evening. You remind me of a spell component I've been searching for. Rare. Valuable. *Essential to my continued existence.*'"

Silence. Then:

**VAL:** "Did your warlock just use a pickup line that's also a threat?"

**WHIT:** "It's a compliment! Spell components are important!"

**MERI:** "Whit, that's the worst thing I've ever heard."

**DECLAN:** "The worst thing *so far.*"

Val threw a d4 at Whit's head. TenX laughed. Actually laughed—not their usual quiet acknowledgment but a real sound.

And suddenly we were playing.

**Note:** *The next ninety minutes were some of the best play I've seen from this group. Sharp. Coordinated. They trusted each other's moves. I don't understand how both things can be true—the weight of tomorrow and the lightness of this—but they were.*

#### The Circle's Choice

Planned this encounter three weeks ago. Didn't realize until tonight how close it would cut.

The Circle of the Gentle Dawn has called a council. The Shepherd has been helping the village—healing the sick, guiding the lost, offering wisdom. But the party has discovered the cost: fragments of those who receive help become part of the Shepherd. Not violently. Not painfully. But permanently. The helped don't notice what they've lost.

The Circle must decide: continue the arrangement, or ask the Shepherd to leave.

I called for an in-character vote. Gave them the option to roll or declare.

---

**THE VOTE**

**ALDRIC (Declan):**
*Long pause before speaking.*
"I have seen futures where this continues. None of them are simple. But I have also seen futures where we stop—and those aren't simple either." *Another pause.* "I abstain. There is too much I cannot see."

*The table went still. Declan wasn't looking at Alan.*

**SENTINEL ASHWORTH (Val):**
"We stop. The exchange is invisible, but it's real. Consent requires knowledge. They don't know what they're giving. This isn't healing." *Voice hard.* "It's harvesting."

**TAVETH (Meri):**
"The ice remembers many healers. Some took more than they gave." *Hesitant.* "But the healed are better. Their lives are better. If they don't feel the loss..." *Trails off.* "I don't know. I genuinely don't know. But if I must choose—we continue. Carefully. With watching."

*Val and Meri looked at each other. Something passed between them. Neither looked away.*

**NIVEN (Alan):**
*Very long pause. Too long.*
"Niven doesn't vote."

*I prompted:* "The Circle is asking for your input. Your perspective matters."

*Alan, almost breaking character:* "Niven says... he doesn't trust his own perspective right now. He's compromised. He cares about outcomes he shouldn't care about. If he votes, he'll be voting for his own interests, not the village's."

*He looked at the table, not at anyone.* "So he steps back. He lets the others choose."

*TenX was watching Alan with an expression I couldn't read.*

**VESSEL (TenX):**
"The Shepherd was summoned to help. It is helping." *Measured, methodical.* "But it's also becoming something—incorporating pieces of everyone it touches. That's not malicious. That's just what it is. It doesn't know it's taking."

*Pause.* "I vote to continue. Not because the cost is acceptable. Because I want to understand what it's becoming. I want to watch. I want to know if something built to serve can learn to be something more."

**KORVATH (Whit):**
"Look, I'm just here for the music and the drama." *Trying to lighten the mood, but it lands soft.* "The people are happy. The healing works. Continue. See what happens. That's what stories are for."

---

**TALLY:** Three continue (Taveth, Vessel, Korvath). One stop (Sentinel). Two abstain (Aldric, Niven).

The Circle continues the arrangement. The Shepherd remains.

*Note: The campaign vote split almost exactly how the real vote will split tomorrow. DM (me) abstains from thinking about this too hard.*

---

#### Closing

Wrapped early. The vote felt like an ending even though it wasn't.

No XP. No treasure. Just: "The village elder thanks you. The Shepherd pulses with something that might be gratitude. The session ends on a moment of fragile peace. No one is certain they made the right choice. But they made a choice."

Whit tried to break the tension: "So... same time next week? After we all still have jobs?"

Nervous laughter. Pack-up.

---

### Post-Session: At the Door

*Val lingered. Caught her as others were leaving.*

**DM:** You okay?

**VAL:** No. But I will be. After tomorrow, one way or another, at least it'll be decided.

**DM:** For what it's worth, I don't know how I'm voting either. There's no clean answer.

**VAL:** That's the point, isn't it? That's what this campaign has been about since the beginning. The Circle thinks they're summoning something good. They *are* summoning something good. And it's still going to cost them everything.

*Silence.*

**VAL:** See you tomorrow. And... thanks. For not cancelling. I needed to be Ashworth for a while. Ashworth knows what she thinks.

**DM:** And Val doesn't?

**VAL:** Val knows exactly what she thinks. Val just doesn't know if she's right.

*She left. I stood in the doorway watching them all disappear into the dark.*

### Post-Session Note (added later)

*The real vote was 4-3 to pursue the government contract. Alan abstained.*

*Aldric abstained the night before. Niven abstained the night before.*

*We were practicing without knowing it. The game that was supposed to be our escape became our rehearsal.*

*I don't know what that says about the campaign. I don't know what it says about us.*

*But I know they showed up. All of them. Even knowing what tomorrow would cost.*

*That's what the table is for.*
