# Curator's Notes: Interlude 4

## On Why We Played

DM texted at 5:14. "Given everything, should we skip tonight?"

Everyone said no. Different words, same answer. No. Please don't. I need this. Same time as always. Play.

We all knew what was happening the next morning. The board meeting. The vote. The decision that would split the company down the middle. Val and I had been on opposite sides for weeks. Meri had stopped looking anyone in the eye. TenX had retreated into code like it was a bunker.

And we chose to sit at a table together and roll dice.

I've thought about that a lot. Why we didn't take the excuse. Why we gathered in DM's apartment when we could barely stand to be in the same room at work. The answer, I think, is that we needed to trust each other somewhere. Even if we couldn't trust each other at the office. Even if tomorrow we'd vote different ways and some of us would feel betrayed.

For two hours, we were a party. That was enough.

## On the Vote

DM swears she didn't plan the parallel. I believe her. She's not that subtle, and this was too precise to be designed.

The Circle voted whether to continue with the Shepherd. Three continue, one stop, two abstain.

The next morning, the board voted whether to pursue the government contract. Four in favor, three against, one abstention. The abstention was mine.

Aldric abstained because he'd seen futures where continuing led to complexity. Niven abstained because he said he was compromised—caring about outcomes he shouldn't care about.

Declan played his character. I played mine.

I didn't realize until later that we'd been practicing. Running through the motions of a decision we weren't ready to make directly. The game gave us a container. The game let us say the things we couldn't say at work.

Niven told the truth: he was compromised. He cared about things he shouldn't.

So did I.

## On Whit's Pickup Line

I should say something about this. The moment where the session went from painful to playable.

Whit tried to seduce an innkeeper using a threat disguised as a compliment. It was objectively terrible. Val threw a die at his head. TenX laughed.

And suddenly we were us again.

I don't know why that worked. I don't know why a bad joke broke the tension when nothing else could. Maybe because it was so clearly Whit—using humor to defuse, finding absurdity in the middle of weight. Maybe because we needed permission to laugh, and Whit gave it to us.

We played better after that. For ninety minutes, we were sharp and coordinated and present. We trusted each other's tactical choices even though we couldn't trust each other's strategic ones.

The Stoics would say something about how we can't control outcomes, only responses. We couldn't control what would happen the next day. We could choose to be a party for one more night.

We chose.

## On Val at the Door

She said: "Ashworth knows what she thinks."

And DM asked: "And Val doesn't?"

And Val said: "Val knows exactly what she thinks. Val just doesn't know if she's right."

That's the difference between conviction and certainty. Ashworth is a paladin. She swore an oath. Her character sheet tells her what she believes. Val is a person. She has to live with consequences.

I think about that conversation whenever I question my own choices. Knowing what you think isn't the same as knowing if you're right. The certainty we feel is often just the character sheet we've written for ourselves—the story we tell about who we are and what we stand for.

Val voted against the pivot the next morning. She lost. She stayed anyway.

I abstained. We'll never know if my vote would have changed anything.

Ashworth would have voted. Ashworth always votes. That's the oath.

Niven stepped back and let others decide. That's the character too.

## On Including This

I could have left this session out. It's private. It's a game night, not a business document.

But the truth is: we were more honest at that table than we were at the office. The game gave us permission to say what we meant. TenX said they wanted to understand what the Shepherd was becoming. Meri said she genuinely didn't know. I said I was compromised.

The board meeting the next day was all careful language and strategic positions. The game table was raw.

I'm including this because you deserve to know who we were when no one was watching. When we weren't performing for investors or documenting for posterity. When we were just friends trying to get through the night before everything changed.

We showed up. We played. We trusted each other with fictional lives even when we couldn't trust each other with real decisions.

That's something. I'm not sure what. But it's something.
