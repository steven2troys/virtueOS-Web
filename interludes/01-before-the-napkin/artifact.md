## [7:23 PM — Pre-Session]

**DM:** Whit texted. He's not coming.

**MERI:** Again?

**DM:** The Delgado case went sideways. Might be there all night.

**DECLAN:** That's the third session he's missed.

**VAL:** Is he okay?

**DM:** He said "fine, just work." You know how he is.

**MERI:** It's not the same without everyone.

*[Pause. Sound of dice being arranged.]*

**DM:** I'll run Korvath as an NPC for combat. He's been... contemplating his patron's demands. Quiet tonight.

**ALAN:** Aren't we all.

**DM:** *[beat]* Okay. Let's play.

## [7:31 PM — Session Start]

**DM:** Last session, you agreed to help the Circle of the Gentle Dawn gather the final components for the Shepherd summoning. Tonight, you're in the Circle's sacred grove. Elder Thessaly is directing preparations. The summoning circle has been drawn in silver and salt. Torches mark the cardinal points. The air smells like cedar smoke and anticipation.

**DECLAN:** Aldric examines the ritual preparations. Looking for anything... unusual.

**DM:** Roll Arcana.

*[Dice roll]*

**DECLAN:** Seventeen.

**DM:** The circle is standard thaumaturgic geometry. Well-constructed. The silver inlay is high quality. If there's anything wrong with the technical setup, you can't see it.

**VAL:** Sentinel approaches the circle itself. I want to examine it.

**DM:** What are you looking for?

**VAL:** I'm not sure. Something feels off. Can I roll Insight?

**DM:** *[pause]* On a summoning circle?

**VAL:** On the situation. The whole thing.

**DM:** *[longer pause]* ...sure. Roll Insight.

*[Dice roll]*

**VAL:** Natural eighteen, plus five. Twenty-three.

**DM:** *[exhale]* Okay. Sentinel stands at the edge of the circle. The geometry is correct. The components are pure. The Circle's intentions are genuine. But something about the design feels... patient. Not wrong. Patient. Like it's been waiting. Not for the ritual. For something else. The circle isn't calling something to you. It's opening a door that was already there.

*[Silence at the table]*

**VAL:** (as Sentinel) We should stop.

**ALAN:** What?

**VAL:** (as Sentinel) Every summoning has a cost. We just don't know who pays yet.

**MERI:** (as Taveth) The ice remembers many summonings. Most were fine.

**ALAN:** (as Niven) Define "fine."

*[Laughter around the table, but Val isn't laughing]*

**DECLAN:** (as Aldric) What did you see, Sentinel?

**VAL:** (as Sentinel) Nothing I can name. A feeling. The geometry is too perfect. Like someone's been practicing.

**DM:** Elder Thessaly approaches. "Is something wrong, paladin? You seem troubled."

**VAL:** (as Sentinel) I'm always troubled. It's why I'm useful.

*[More laughter. Val writes something in her notes.]*

---

## [8:14 PM — The Final Component]

**DM:** The last component is a Shepherd's crook, blessed by three generations of the Circle. Elder Thessaly presents it to the party.

**DM:** (as Thessaly) "This belonged to my grandmother. And her mother before her. When the Shepherd arrives, it will recognize the crook as a symbol of our devotion. Our welcome."

**MERI:** (as Taveth) And if it doesn't?

**DM:** (as Thessaly) *[soft smile]* It will. The texts are clear. The Shepherd guides the lost home. We have been lost for so long. It will see our need and answer.

**ALAN:** *[out of character]* They really believe this, don't they?

**DM:** Completely. The Circle has been preparing for generations. They've done everything right. They're certain.

**ALAN:** That's what scares me.

**DECLAN:** The certainty or the preparation?

**ALAN:** Yes.

---

## [8:47 PM — Niven's Hesitation]

**DM:** One of the younger cultists approaches Niven. She's maybe seventeen, wearing the novice robes of the Circle. She looks nervous but determined.

**DM:** (as novice) "Excuse me. You're with the adventurers, aren't you? The ones helping with the summoning?"

**ALAN:** (as Niven) That's one way to describe us.

**DM:** (as novice) "I wanted to ask... do you trust the Circle's intentions? I've been a novice for two years. Everything they've taught me says this is right. That the Shepherd will help us. But..." She trails off.

**ALAN:** *[long pause]*

**DM:** The novice waits. What does Niven say?

*[Extended silence. Sound of Alan shifting in his chair.]*

**ALAN:** (as Niven) He doesn't know. He wants to trust them. He's just not sure trust is something he's good at.

*[The table goes quiet. That wasn't entirely in character.]*

**DM:** The novice nods slowly. "That's... honest. I appreciate honest." She returns to her duties.

**DECLAN:** *[quietly, to Alan]* You okay?

**ALAN:** Yeah. Just tired. Keep going.

## [9:22 PM — Combat Encounter]

**DM:** As you secure the final preparations, movement in the treeline. Roll initiative.

*[Dice clatter]*

**DM:** Four corrupted wolves emerge from the forest. They're drawn to the ritual energy. Hungry.

**VAL:** Sentinel moves to intercept. "Behind me."

**DM:** Korvath hangs back, uncertain. Without Whit directing him, he's hesitant.

**DECLAN:** Can Aldric give him tactical direction?

**DM:** Sure, but it'll cost your bonus action each round.

**DECLAN:** Fine. We need the damage output.

*[Combat proceeds. The party is disorganized without their tank.]*

**MERI:** Taveth casts Entangle on the two flanking left.

**DM:** They're restrained. Sentinel, you're exposed on the right.

**VAL:** I can hold.

**DM:** Roll constitution save against the lead wolf's bite.

*[Dice roll]*

**VAL:** Eight. Damn.

**DM:** Fourteen damage. You're bloodied.

**DECLAN:** Aldric burns Fireball. I'm not losing her.

**DM:** That's your third-level slot.

**DECLAN:** I know what it is.

*[Dice roll for damage. Combat continues.]*

---

## [9:41 PM — After Combat]

**DM:** The wolves are dead. The Circle's guards are cleaning up the bodies. Everyone catches their breath.

**DECLAN:** *[out of character]* We needed Whit tonight.

**DM:** I know. He'll be back next week.

**MERI:** Will he? The case sounded bad.

**DM:** He always comes back.

*[A beat. Then:]*

**VAL:** Sentinel checks her wounds. "The wolves were drawn to the ritual. They felt it from miles away."

**DM:** (as Elder Thessaly) "A sign. Even the corrupted things sense what we're calling. Imagine what the pure will do when the Shepherd arrives."

**VAL:** (as Sentinel) I am imagining it. That's what worries me.

---

## [10:15 PM — Session End]

**DM:** The components are gathered. The circle is prepared. The Circle of the Gentle Dawn will perform the summoning next session. Elder Thessaly thanks you for your help. "Tomorrow, everything changes," she says. "Tomorrow, we bring the Shepherd home."

**DECLAN:** (as Aldric) "I hope you're right about what that means."

**DM:** She smiles. "Faith, wizard. Have faith."

*[Sound of dice being put away]*

**DM:** That's where we'll pick up. Everyone's excited about the summoning, yes?

**VAL:** *[not answering directly]* The geometry still bothers me.

**DM:** You're always overthinking it. That's why I love having you at the table.

**VAL:** *[pause]* Yeah.

---

## [10:23 PM — Post-Session]

*[Recording continues as people pack up. Most conversation is indistinct. Then:]*

**DM:** Alan. Hang back a second?

**ALAN:** Yeah?

**DM:** You okay? You seemed distant tonight. Niven was making calls he wouldn't normally make.

**ALAN:** I'm fine. Work stuff. Money stuff. The usual.

**DM:** If you need to talk—

**ALAN:** I'm fine. I will be. Just need to figure some things out.

**DM:** Okay. But I'm here. If you need.

**ALAN:** I know. Thanks.

*[Sound of door closing]*

**Transcription Notes:**

This recording was made October 7, 2026. One week before Alan drew the napkin at O'Malley's. One week before everything started.

The summoning arc was never completed. Real life interrupted. But the questions we asked that night kept asking themselves, long after we stopped playing.
