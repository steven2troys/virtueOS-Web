# Alan's Notes

I found these in DM's campaign binder.

She keeps everything. Session notes, initiative trackers, the scratch paper where she tracks monster HP. Eleven years of Thursdays, organized in manila folders by arc. The Hidden Wolf stuff takes up three folders. I borrowed them without asking. She'd understand.

This session was October 2026. One week before the napkin.

I remember almost nothing about it. The transcript brings back fragments. The wolves. Val's weird Insight roll. That novice who asked me about trust. I don't remember her face. I barely remember my answer. I was so far inside my own head that night, I could have been playing anyone.

Here's what I do remember: I was broke. Not metaphorically broke, not "I should really cut back on coffee" broke. Actually broke. Three months behind on rent, credit cards maxed, eating ramen not for nostalgia but because it cost nineteen cents. The startup I'd been contracting for had folded. My savings were gone. I was calculating which bills I could delay longest without destroying my credit score entirely.

And I didn't tell anyone.

That's the part that gets me, looking back. I sat at that table with four people who'd known me for years. People who would have helped. DM had money saved from her database exit. Declan would have spotted me a loan without hesitation. Val's paranoid, but she's generous when it matters. Meri was stretched thin herself, but she'd have figured something out.

I didn't ask. I didn't even hint. I just played Niven and let him be uncertain so I wouldn't have to be.

"He doesn't know. He wants to trust them. He's just not sure trust is something he's good at."

That was me talking. The novice in her Circle robes, asking a simple question, and I answered for myself instead of my character. DM noticed. She always notices. She caught me after the session, gave me an opening. "If you need to talk—"

I closed the door.

A week later, I was at O'Malley's, three beers deep, drawing on a napkin. Angry about everything and nothing. The diagram came out in a rush. AR glasses that whisper Stoic wisdom. Three AI advisors based on dead philosophers. An operating system for the soul. It was ridiculous. It was also the first time in months I'd felt anything except tired.

The napkin became virtueOS. virtueOS became Marble Porch. Marble Porch became everything that came after.

But that night, October 7, 2026? Nothing important happened. We rolled dice. We killed wolves. Val got a weird feeling about a summoning circle. Whit wasn't there and we felt the gap.

Everything important happened.

Val's note in the margin of her character sheet: "The geometry is patient. Door already there. WHO PUT IT THERE?"

I didn't notice it at the time. I notice it now. Val was asking about the campaign. She was also asking about something else. She just didn't know what yet.

The Circle of the Gentle Dawn thought they were summoning a benevolent spirit. They'd done the research. They'd prepared for generations. They were sincere. DM let them be sincere because sincerity is the most dangerous kind of wrong.

A year later, we'd be sitting in a conference room voting on whether to let the government fund virtueOS. The geometry would be perfect. The intentions would be genuine. And Val would be the only one asking: who pays the cost?

We never finished the summoning arc. Real life got in the way. But I still think about it sometimes. The Shepherd that was supposed to "guide the lost home." The door that was already there, just waiting for someone to open it.

The novice in her robes, asking if I trusted the Circle's intentions.

I said I didn't know. I said trust wasn't something I was good at.

At least I was honest about that.

DM's handwriting at the bottom of her session notes:

*"Alan seems off. Asked to talk after. He said he was fine. He's not fine. Neither was Niven. Watch."*

She watched. I wasn't ready to be seen. Sometimes that's how it goes. You can offer someone a door. You can't make them walk through it.

A week later, I drew my own door on a napkin. A door that was already there, maybe. Waiting for someone desperate enough to open it.

Who pays the cost? The Circle thought they knew. They didn't. We thought we knew. We didn't either.

Val asked the right question. We just weren't ready to hear the answer.
