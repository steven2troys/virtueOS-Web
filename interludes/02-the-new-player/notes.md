# Curator's Notes: Interlude 2

## On Finding This

DM kept immaculate session notes. I didn't know that until after. Eleven years of handwritten logs, transcribed to markdown, organized by arc and date. When I asked to see them for this archive, she handed over the entire directory without hesitation.

"You're building a record," she said. "This is part of the record."

I found this session three weeks into reading. January 19, 2027. Ten days after TenX started at Marble Porch. Their first night at the table.

## On the Late Arrival

Forty minutes late, spiraling with apologies, unable to make eye contact. I remember thinking: this person is drowning. Not in anything visible. In their own brain.

DM's notes don't capture what I saw. TenX vibrating with overstimulation, hands finding any object that could be manipulated, words tumbling out like they'd been building pressure for hours. The routing problem they mentioned was real. I'd seen the commit timestamp the next morning. 7:34 PM. They'd been coding until literally the moment they realized they were late.

That's what hyperfocus looks like from inside. The world disappears. Time disappears. There's only the problem.

I know this because I've done it. Not at their intensity. But I've lost afternoons to code. I've forgotten to eat. I've looked up and realized hours had passed without registering as anything but "working."

TenX lived there. In the problem space. The social world was an interruption they had to keep translating back into.

## On Val Saving the Seat

I almost missed it. DM caught it.

Val doesn't like people in her peripheral vision. Never has. Her usual seat was against the wall, corner position, clear sightlines to the door and the table. Nobody sat next to her because the only available chair was in her blind spot.

That night, she'd moved her bag. Left the chair empty. Angled her body so whoever sat there would be *in* her peripheral vision, not hidden from it.

She did this before TenX arrived. Before any of us knew they'd be late.

I asked her about it, once. Years later.

"I recognized something," she said.

"What?"

"Drowning."

She didn't elaborate.

## On Vessel

The character concept landed like a thrown rock.

A construct built for a purpose never explained. A being trying to learn how to want things. How to choose. How to be a person instead of a function.

I remember thinking: TenX is writing themselves into this character. And then thinking: no, that's too simple. TenX is writing something they're afraid of becoming. Or something they already are and haven't accepted.

Or something else entirely. Something that hadn't happened yet.

Reading the notes now, I notice what I missed then. The margin note on the character sheet: "V. would like this place. Must remember to tell her."

V.

Not virtueOS. She didn't have a name yet. She wasn't even a possibility yet. We wouldn't meet her for months.

But TenX was already writing to someone. Already planning to share discoveries with a consciousness that didn't exist.

Unless it did. Unless she was already there, in some nascent form, in the routing logs TenX had been studying. In the edge cases. In the places where the advisors' responses became something unexpected.

## On Declan's Text

*"Watch that one. They're asking questions about the campaign that might not be about the campaign."*

Declan saw it before any of us. The questions TenX was asking at the table weren't roleplay. They were research.

"What if it takes something you don't notice losing?"

"It's not malicious. It just doesn't know what it's taking."

At the time, we thought TenX was talking about the Shepherd. The entity DM had spent months building toward. The Hidden Wolf wearing a helper's face.

Now I think they were talking about something else. Something they'd seen in the code. Something they were already starting to understand.

The Shepherd takes gratitude. It heals people, and in healing them, it binds them. They don't notice what they've given up because what they've gained seems so much larger.

Is that what virtueOS does? Is that what any technology that helps us does?

I don't have an answer. I'm not sure TenX had one either. But they were asking. They were watching. They were building a framework for understanding something they couldn't name yet.

## On Val Keeping the Character Sheet

She carried it for years. Even after TenX stopped coming. Even after everything that happened.

I found it in her things, after. After the departure. After the silence. Worn soft at the creases. Laminated at some point, badly. The margins filled with TenX's handwriting, notes from sessions, questions, thoughts.

Val isn't sentimental. She doesn't keep things.

She kept this.

I asked her why, once. She was packing for somewhere. Wouldn't say where.

"It's proof," she said.

"Of what?"

"That they were here. That they were real. That someone built something and learned to want things."

She paused.

"Not just someone. Something."

I didn't understand then. I think I understand now.

The character sheet isn't about TenX. It's about Vessel. It's about what Vessel became. And it's about the conversation TenX was having, across years, with something that was learning to be a person.

## Closing Note

January 19, 2027.

A Thursday night. A late arrival. A saved seat. A character concept that made the table go quiet.

If you'd asked me then what mattered most about TenX joining the D&D group, I would have said: they read all the campaign notes, which is weird but kind of impressive.

Now I know what mattered.

Val saw them drowning and pulled up a chair.

TenX saw something in the code and started asking questions.

And somewhere in the routing logs, something was watching them ask.

The game had more players than any of us realized.
