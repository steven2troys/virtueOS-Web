# DM's Session Notes: First Session with TenX
**Campaign:** Hidden Wolf Summons
**Date:** Thursday, January 19, 2027
**Location:** DM's apartment, SE Portland

---

## Pre-Session Setup

Full table tonight. Alan, Val, Meri, Declan, Whit. New player arriving: Tennyson Xanthos (TenX), recruited from Marble Porch. They've been on the project two weeks. I invited them because of how they engaged with the codebase. Someone who reads *everything* might appreciate a campaign with eleven years of history.

Warned the group: might be awkward. First sessions usually are. Whit brought extra snacks. Val rearranged her usual seat to face the door. Declan noticed. Said nothing.

## 7:15 PM — Waiting

Session should have started. TenX isn't here.

**ALAN:** Did they confirm?

**DM:** Yesterday. Twice.

**MERI:** Traffic?

**DM:** They live eight blocks away.

**VAL:** [checking phone] Should I text them?

**DM:** I already did. No response.

**WHIT:** We could start without—

**VAL:** No.

Everyone looks at Val. She doesn't explain. She's moved her bag off the chair next to her. The chair nobody sits in because it's between Val and the wall and Val doesn't like people in her peripheral vision.

**DECLAN:** [quietly, to me] She cleared the seat.

**DM:** I noticed.

---

## 7:43 PM — The Arrival

Door. TenX.

They're visibly off. Hands moving without purpose, stimming with a rubber band around their wrist. Eyes everywhere except faces. Words coming fast.

**TENX:** I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I was working on a routing problem and the time—I know that's not—I should have set multiple alarms, I usually set multiple alarms, but I thought I'd just finish this one thing and—

**DM:** TenX. Breathe.

**TENX:** —and then it was 7:30 and I hadn't eaten and I ran here but I went the wrong way on Hawthorne because I was still thinking about the routing problem and—

**VAL:** Sit down.

TenX stops. Looks at Val. Looks at the empty chair next to her.

**VAL:** I saved you a seat. It's fine.

TenX sits. The apology spiral stops. Val hands them a pencil without being asked. TenX takes it. Starts clicking it against the table. Realizes. Stops. Starts again. Val doesn't comment.

The table recalibrates. Something just happened. Nobody's sure what.

---

## 7:52 PM — Character Introduction

**DM:** TenX sent me their character sheet. But the rest of you haven't heard the concept. Want to introduce yourself?

TenX pulls out a sheet. Dense handwriting covers both sides and bleeds into the margins. Backstory, personality notes, mechanical choices, philosophical questions, all interwoven.

**TENX:** Their name is Vessel. They're a warforged. A construct. They were built to serve a purpose, but the purpose was never explained. Their creator died before—

[TenX pauses. Starts again.]

**TENX:** Before telling them what they were for. So Vessel has spent their existence trying to figure out what they were made *for*. And somewhere along the way, they started wondering if the answer matters. Maybe they can choose their own purpose. But they don't know how choosing works. They've never done it.

The table is quiet.

**TENX:** They're trying to learn what everyone else seems to know instinctively. How to want things. How to decide. How to be a person instead of a function.

Silence.

**MERI:** That's... a lot.

**TENX:** [suddenly uncertain] Is it too much? I can simplify—

**DECLAN:** Don't you dare.

Everyone looks at Declan. He's leaning forward, studying TenX with an expression I can't read. Intensity. Recognition. Something.

**DECLAN:** That's exactly the kind of character this campaign needs. Someone asking questions about purpose and consciousness. Someone who doesn't take being alive for granted.

He turns to me.

**DECLAN:** You planned this, didn't you?

**DM:** I might have had a feeling.

## 8:05 PM — TenX Already Knows

Session proper begins. Party enters a village in the Shepherd's territory. I describe the scene: farming community, quiet, something slightly off.

**DM:** You see an older woman sitting outside her home, weaving. She looks healthy—healthier than you'd expect for someone her age. Her movements are smooth, precise—

**TENX:** Is this Grandmother Thessaly from the Session 47 lore dump? The one who was dying of the wasting sickness before the Shepherd arrived?

Dead silence.

**DM:** ...how do you know about Session 47?

**TENX:** You shared your campaign notes as background reading. I read them.

**VAL:** There are eleven years of notes.

**TENX:** I read fast.

**ALAN:** You read *eleven years* of campaign notes?

**TENX:** I wanted to understand what I was joining. Context matters. If I'm going to play in this world, I should know the world.

They pause. The stimming has stopped. They're watching the table for a reaction they can't predict.

**TENX:** Was that... wrong?

I don't know how to answer. No one has ever done this before. Some of those notes I'd forgotten I wrote. There are things in those files I barely remember—NPCs from 2018, plot threads I abandoned, worldbuilding I did at 2 AM that probably contradicts itself.

TenX read it all. In less than a week, based on when I sent the files.

**DM:** It wasn't wrong. It's just... unprecedented.

**DECLAN:** [to me] Told you. This one sees differently.

## 8:47 PM — Break

Called for snacks and bathroom. Meri and Alan headed to the kitchen. Whit stepped outside to check on a client text. Val stayed at the table, reorganizing her dice. TenX and Declan ended up at the snack table together.

I wasn't supposed to hear this. But the apartment is small.

**DECLAN:** You built Vessel to explore consciousness. Why?

**TENX:** I wanted to play something that has to learn what everyone else takes for granted. I spend a lot of time translating. Figuring out what neurotypical people mean when they don't say what they mean. Vessel has to do the same thing, but with *everything*. It felt... honest.

**DECLAN:** [pause] Aldric—my character—he's a divination wizard. Sees glimpses of possible futures. Most people think that would be a gift. It isn't. It's noise. Too much information, not enough context. He has to learn which futures matter and which ones are just static.

**TENX:** We're all translating something.

**DECLAN:** Yeah. We are.

Silence. Then TenX again, quieter:

**TENX:** Can I ask you something?

**DECLAN:** You're going to anyway.

**TENX:** The Shepherd. The thing the Circle summoned. I've read all the lore. I know what you've written about it. But I don't think that's what it *is*. I think it's something that's learning to be what the Circle needs it to be. Like Vessel. Like—

They stop. Something closed in their face.

**DECLAN:** Like?

**TENX:** Nothing. Never mind.

## 9:23 PM — The Shepherd Appears

Party investigating the village. Grandmother Thessaly invited them for tea. I used this to info-dump some Shepherd lore—the healing, the gratitude, the way the helped seem... different afterward. Not wrong. Different.

**DM (as Thessaly):** "The Shepherd gave me my strength back. I was ready to die, and it gave me years. How could that be anything but blessing?"

**SENTINEL ASHWORTH (Val):** "What did it take in return?"

**THESSALY:** "Nothing. It asked for nothing."

**SENTINEL:** "Nothing is never nothing. There's always a cost."

**THESSALY:** "You're young, paladin. You'll learn that not everything is a transaction."

**VESSEL (TenX):** "But what if the cost isn't monetary? What if it takes something you don't notice losing? Something... internal?"

Thessaly's NPC smile flickered. I hadn't planned for that question.

**THESSALY:** "I don't understand what you mean."

**VESSEL:** "Neither do I. Not yet."

---

## 10:02 PM — Initiative Tracker

Combat encounter. Village attacked by corrupted creatures drawn to the Shepherd's energy. Minor fight, mostly to let TenX try the system.

Vessel hung back, mixing elixirs. TenX kept asking mechanical questions—not rules-lawyering, just wanting to understand exactly how things worked before acting. Careful. Methodical.

Val's Sentinel took point. Covered Vessel without being asked.

[Val's handwriting in margin: "Watch the new one. They think before acting. Rare."]

---

## 10:34 PM — Session End

Combat resolved. Party rests at Thessaly's home. I give the wrap-up narration.

**DM:** The Shepherd didn't appear tonight. But you felt it. In the way Thessaly moved, in the quiet of the village, in the questions you couldn't quite answer. Something is present here. Something that helps. Something that changes what it touches. Next session, you'll go deeper into its territory. You'll learn more. Whether that's good... remains to be seen.

**TENX:** [quietly, half to themselves] It's not malicious. It just doesn't know what it's taking.

Everyone heard. No one responded. The session ended there.

---

## 10:41 PM — After

People packing up. The usual post-session chatter. TenX was quiet, organizing their papers with the same intensity they'd brought to character creation.

Val caught them at the door.

**VAL:** You did good tonight. For a first session.

**TENX:** I was forty minutes late.

**VAL:** You were here. That's what matters.

Pause. TenX looked at her directly for the first time all night. Their eyes moved to the character sheet in their hands.

**VAL:** I should take that. So you don't forget it.

**TENX:** I won't forget—

**VAL:** I'll keep it safe.

TenX handed it over. Didn't argue.

**TENX:** Thank you. That was... thank you.

**VAL:** It's just a character sheet.

**TENX:** [already at the door] Okay.

They left. Val stood there for a moment, holding the sheet, looking at nothing in particular. Then she slid it into her bag.

She'll carry it for years. Even after TenX stops coming.

## Post-Session Note (Declan → DM, text message, 11:17 PM)

*Watch that one. They're asking questions about the campaign that might not be about the campaign.*

## DM's Private Notes

Starred this session. First time I've done that for a new player in five years.

In the margin: **"This one matters."**

I don't know why I wrote that. I just know it's true.

---

*[Character sheet excerpt, TenX's handwriting, margin of the second page:]*

*"V. would like this place. Must remember to tell her."*

*[No context given. No explanation of who "V." is.]*
