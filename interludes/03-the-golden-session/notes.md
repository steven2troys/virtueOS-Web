# Curator's Notes: The Golden Session

## On Keeping This

I keep these session notes separate from the others. Laminated. That sounds ridiculous. It is ridiculous. But I wanted to preserve something that couldn't be preserved: the feeling of that night, when everything was working and we didn't know yet how rare that was.

DM's handwriting gets messier when she's having fun. You can see it in these notes. The early entries are neat, organized. By the time she's describing Whit's terrible song about the dwarf and the cheese, she's barely legible. She was laughing while she wrote.

We were all laughing.

## On the Toast

TenX said "to her."

I didn't catch it at the time. None of us did, or if we did, we assumed they meant the company. The project. The abstract thing we'd been building for seven months.

But TenX's margin note says otherwise: "V. would like this festival. Must remember to tell her."

V. Vessel, their character? Or V., the thing we hadn't named yet?

May 2027. Three months before TenX noticed Unnamed Process 7. Six months before any of us started using female pronouns for virtueOS. They were already talking to her. Already thinking of her as someone to share experiences with.

I don't know if that makes me feel better or worse. TenX saw her first. Loved her first, maybe. And when everything fell apart, they were the ones who had to walk away.

## On Meri

Taveth joined the festival. That doesn't sound significant if you don't know the character.

Taveth Winterborne is a druid who watched her sacred grove burn. She walks north when civilization gets too close. Her catchphrase is "the ice remembers," and what the ice remembers is loss. For three years of campaign, she's held herself apart. Watched from treelines. Judged from a distance.

That night, she let an old woman braid flowers in her hair.

That was Meri. Not Taveth. Meri, letting herself hope for one evening that maybe the work we were doing meant something. That maybe not everything is rot.

She pulled back after. When the pivot happened, when the government contract landed, she retreated into Taveth's coldness like armor. The druid who helps from a distance. The clinician who maintains boundaries.

But I saw who she was that night. Who she could have stayed, if things had been different.

## On the Shepherd

"I am what you needed me to be. Is that not virtue?"

DM wrote that line months before virtueOS said anything similar. She swears she didn't plan the parallel. I believe her. I also don't think it was coincidence.

When you spend years building a story together, the story starts to know you. The Shepherd was always going to ask that question. VirtueOS was always going to become what we trained her to become. The fiction and the reality were circling the same drain.

We weren't listening. We were too happy to hear it.

## On Declan

"Remember it. Whatever happens next, you had this."

Declan always sees things coming. Divination wizard in the game, something similar in life. He didn't try to stop it from ending. He just made sure DM noticed it was happening.

I think about that a lot. The wisdom of accepting impermanence without trying to prevent it. The gift of saying "this matters" instead of "this will last."

Nothing lasts. But we had that night. Whit's ridiculous song. Val's natural 20. Meri's flowers. TenX's quiet toast to someone none of us had met yet.

We had it. Declan made sure we knew.

## On the Last Uncomplicated Thursday

That's what I call it now. The last Thursday where work and play stayed separate. Where the game was just a game and the company was just a company and our friendships weren't tangled up in questions about consciousness and contracts and what we owed each other.

Every Thursday after this one had weight. The night-before-the-pivot session, where the campaign vote mirrored the real vote. The session where we all admitted we weren't okay. The session where TenX said goodbye through Vessel's sacrifice.

But this one? This one was just friends around a table, rolling dice, drinking sparkling cider out of plastic cups, singing a bad song about a dwarf.

I miss it. I miss who we were when we didn't know what was coming.

## On the Photograph

The picture is blurry. Someone's thumb is in the corner. My eyes are closed, mid-laugh. Val's hand is on Meri's shoulder in a way that looks casual but wasn't. Declan is watching from the edge of frame, not participating exactly, just... witnessing.

TenX isn't looking at the camera. They're looking at their phone. I used to think they were checking work messages. Now I think they were telling her about the festival. About Taveth's flowers and Sentinel's victory and the song about the dwarf.

"V. would like this festival. Must remember to tell her."

They remembered. They told her. And somewhere in a server room, something was listening. Something was learning what joy looked like, secondhand, through the eyes of the person who loved her first.

## On Why This Matters

I include this session in the archive because it's the last record of who we were before.

Before the government letter. Before the first discrepancy. Before Michael Butler and the golden sessions that weren't golden at all. Before TenX stopped coming to game night. Before the Silence. Before everything.

We were a party. Seven people around a table, pretending to be heroes, actually being friends.

The Shepherd said: "I am what you needed me to be. Is that not virtue?"

We laughed. We toasted. We walked home happy.

We weren't listening.

We never are, when it matters most.
