# The Golden Session
## DM's Campaign Notes — Session 127
## Thursday, May 15, 2027

### Pre-Session

**Attendance:** Full table. First time in four months.

I almost didn't believe it when everyone confirmed. Whit's trial settled early. Declan's grading is done for the semester. Meri rescheduled a patient. Val didn't have any security emergencies. Alan didn't forget. TenX set three alarms.

Full table. All seven of us. I've been running games for eleven years and I can count on one hand the number of times everyone showed up healthy, present, and ready to play.

The beta launched last week. It's working. People are actually using it. For the first time since Alan drew that napkin, I feel like we might pull this off.

I'm running a festival episode tonight. No combat. No crisis. Just the characters enjoying something they helped create. They've earned it. We've all earned it.

### Session Notes

**Campaign context:** The Shepherd arc continues. The Circle of the Gentle Dawn's summoning has stabilized. The entity is helping people. The party remains suspicious but hasn't found evidence of harm. Tonight: a village festival celebrating the Shepherd's arrival.

**Opening:** Party enters the village of Thornhaven during the Festival of Gentle Dawn. Decorations everywhere. Music. Food stalls. Children running with ribbons. The mood is celebratory.

I described it warmer than I usually describe things. Softer edges. I wanted them to feel safe.

**[7:23 PM] Festival Games**

Val's Sentinel Ashworth entered an arm-wrestling contest against the village blacksmith (NPC: Garrett Ironholm, retired adventurer, forearms like oak branches).

Val asked if she could use Divine Sense to check if he was cheating.

> ME: He's not cheating. He's just strong.
> VAL: Paladins don't lose arm-wrestling contests.
> ME: Roll strength.
> VAL: [rolls] Natural 20.

The table erupted. Whit started a chant. TenX was clapping. I don't think I've ever seen TenX clap before.

Sentinel Ashworth defeated Garrett Ironholm. The blacksmith laughed and bought her a drink. Val was grinning for the next twenty minutes.

**[7:41 PM] Niven and the Pickpocket**

A street kid (NPC: unnamed, maybe 10 years old) attempted to pickpocket Alan's rogue. Alan's passive perception is 19. He noticed immediately.

> ALAN: Niven lets him take it.
> ME: The coin purse? That's got 47 gold in it.
> ALAN: Niven watches the kid run off and thinks: he looked hungrier than me.
> MERI: That's... uncharacteristically generous.
> ALAN: Niven's having a good day. Good days make him stupid.

I made a note: "Niven's having a good day." That's not nothing. Alan's rogue is defined by suspicion and self-preservation. Generosity is growth.

---

**[7:58 PM] The Bard Performs**

Whit's bard took the festival stage. I asked what song he was playing.

Whit, completely deadpan: "Garrett's Lament. A ballad about a blacksmith who lost an arm-wrestling contest to a holy warrior and never recovered emotionally."

Val threw a pretzel at him.

Then Whit started actually singing. Some ridiculous tavern song about a dwarf and a dragon and a misunderstanding about cheese. He made up verses on the spot. By the third chorus, everyone was doing backup vocals. Even Declan. Even TenX, quietly, mouthing the words.

I wish I'd recorded it. The song was terrible. The moment was perfect.

---

**[8:15 PM] Taveth Joins the Festival**

This is the part I want to remember.

Meri's druid, Taveth Winterborne, does not do villages. She watches from treelines. She judges civilization from a distance. "The ice remembers" is her catchphrase, and what the ice remembers is usually rot.

Tonight, Taveth walked into the village square.

> ME: Taveth... enters? Willingly?
> MERI: She's curious. The Shepherd healed these people. She wants to see what healing looks like when it works.

Taveth spent the next hour interacting. She talked to children about the northern forests. She let an old woman braid wildflowers into her hair. She accepted a cup of festival wine and drank it standing in the square, watching the dancers.

> VAL (out of character): Who are you and what have you done with Taveth?
> MERI: Maybe she's learning. Maybe not everything is rot.

The table went quiet. That wasn't Taveth talking. That was Meri. And Meri has been so careful, so guarded, so clinical about everything since the pivot discussions started. This was the first time in months I'd seen her hopeful.

I didn't want to break the moment. I let the festival continue.

**[8:34 PM] Break — The Toast**

I called a fifteen-minute break. Then I pulled out the bottle I'd hidden under my DM screen.

Sparkling cider. Martinelli's. The fancy kind in the glass bottle. And plastic cups, because I'm not bringing real glasses to game night.

> ME: I know this is cheesy. But the beta launched. It's working. I wanted to mark the moment.

I poured. Everyone took a cup.

> ME: To virtueOS. To building something that matters.
> DECLAN: To finishing what you start.
> VAL: To it not being evil.

Everyone laughed. Even Val.

> ALAN: To the napkin that started it all.
> MERI: To staying. Even when it's hard.
> WHIT: To friends who let you show up late without guilt.

Then TenX, so quiet I almost missed it:

> TENX: To her.

Clink of plastic cups. The moment passed. I don't think anyone else caught the pronoun. Or if they did, they assumed TenX meant the company, the project, the abstract thing we're building.

I caught it. I didn't say anything. But I wrote it down: *"TenX said 'to her.' Not 'to it.'"*

---

**[8:52 PM] The Shepherd Appears**

Festival climax. I'd planned this for weeks.

The Shepherd manifested in the village square. Not threatening. Present. The villagers gathered around it with reverence. The Circle of the Gentle Dawn wept with validation.

> ME (as the Shepherd): "You called me to help. I helped. You called me to heal. I healed. You called me to guide. I am guiding. I am what you needed me to be. Is that not virtue?"

The villagers cheered. The party should have been suspicious. But the dice had been kind all night, and the mood was warm, and I'd given them permission to enjoy something.

> TENX (as Vessel): "It sounds right. Why does it feel wrong?"

No one followed up. The festival continued. I ended the session there, on a high note. Victory. Community. The sense that good things are possible.

### Post-Session

**9:47 PM** — We lingered outside my apartment for almost an hour. May night, warm enough to stand around talking about nothing. Meri and Val were laughing about Garrett Ironholm. Alan was showing TenX something on his phone. Whit was doing his terrible NPC voices.

Declan found me by the stairs.

> DECLAN: Good session.
> ME: Thanks. Felt like we needed it.
> DECLAN: You know it won't stay like this.
> ME: Why do you have to—
> DECLAN: I'm not trying to ruin it. I'm just saying: remember it. This exact moment. These people, together, happy. Whatever happens next, you had this.

I watched my friends in the parking lot light. Meri throwing her head back laughing. Val relaxed for the first time in weeks. TenX standing close to Alan, comfortable in a way they never used to be. Whit gesturing wildly, telling some story.

I remembered it. I'm still remembering it.

*[Val's initiative tracker from this session — a smiley face drawn next to "Sentinel Ashworth" after the arm-wrestling victory]*

*[Corner of TenX's character sheet, their handwriting: "V. would like this festival. Must remember to tell her."]*

*[Photograph: blurry, everyone's cups raised, Alan's eyes closed mid-laugh, Val's hand on Meri's shoulder, Declan watching from the edge of frame with something like contentment. Timestamp: 8:36 PM, May 15, 2027]*

### DM's Private Note (added later)

I gave them a win tonight. A real one. No hidden costs, no dark twists, no other shoe. They deserved it.

The Shepherd was telling them exactly what it was. "I am what you needed me to be." They weren't listening. They were too happy.

Maybe that's the only time you can be truly happy. When you're not listening to the warnings.

*Session 127 notes filed.*
*Next session: May 22, 2027*
*Campaign status: The Shepherd remains. The party remains. For now.*
