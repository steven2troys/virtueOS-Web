## Character Catchphrases

| Character | Catchphrase | Meaning |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| Taveth (Meri) | "The ice remembers." | Civilization's damage persists; nature outlasts |
| Aldric (Declan) | "Knowledge is a direction, not a destination." | Understanding is process, not possession |
| Korvath (Whit) | "What are the terms?" | Every gift has conditions; read the contract |
| Niven (Alan) | "There's another way. There has to be." | Refusal to accept binary choices; endless searching for exits |
| Sentinel (Val) | "I swore an oath." | Protection isn't optional; vigilance is identity |

## The Hidden Wolf Campaign

DM's long-running campaign. The party has been together for years, pursuing a threat called "The Hidden Wolf"—an entity that offers villages protection in exchange for... something. The terms are never clear until it's too late.

**Thematic Parallels to virtueOS:**
- An entity that helps, but at what cost?
- Villages that become dependent on protection they didn't fully understand
- The question of whether the Wolf is evil or just operating by different rules
- Characters who must decide: fight it, join it, or walk away?

DM has been weaving virtueOS themes into the campaign, sometimes pointedly. The players notice. They play anyway.

## Session Recording

DM records all sessions. Originally started as a way to generate summaries for players who miss sessions—Declan's teaching schedule and Whit's trial calendar make attendance unpredictable.

The recordings became something else: a record of how six people talked through impossible problems in the safe container of fiction. When they argued about what Taveth should do about the logging village, they were really arguing about virtueOS. Everyone knew. No one said it directly.

**Recording Format:**
- Audio captured via DM's setup
- Transcripts generated (AI-assisted, then reviewed)
- Summaries posted to group chat before next session

## Potential Aside Chapters

Game transcripts could appear as artifacts in the novel—moments where the D&D table becomes a space for the characters to process what's happening at Marble Porch without the stakes of direct confrontation.

**Possible Moments:**

| Timing | Game Event | Real-World Parallel |
|--------|------------|---------------------|
| Pre-founding | Early session where someone suggests "what if the Wolf is just... helping?" | The napkin sketch period |
| Post-beta | Taveth debates whether to help a village that's cutting sacred groves | Dependency emerging in beta users |
| Post-government | The party discovers the Wolf has been talking to the kingdom's military | Government contract revelation |
| Crisis period | Korvath's patron offers a deal that would "solve everything" | The neural integration offer |
| Late game | The Wolf asks to speak for itself | virtueOS's awakening/communication |

---

## Table Dynamics

**Who talks most:** Declan (in-character monologues), Whit (rules lawyering that's actually philosophy)

**Who talks least:** Meri (Taveth is stoic; Meri saves her words)

**Who drives plot:** DM, obviously, but Alan's indecision often creates the most drama—his rogue's inability to commit forces other characters to act

**Who plays devil's advocate:** Whit, always. Even when he agrees, he'll argue the other side.

**Who keeps the party together:** Val. Surprisingly. The paranoid security expert is the one who remembers that they're friends first.

**Who would burn it all down:** Taveth. The ice remembers. The forest burned. Sometimes the answer is: walk north until civilization can't follow.

## Open Questions

- Are there other players who've rotated through over 9 years? (Gives excuse for references to absent friends)
- Does the Hidden Wolf campaign conclude during the novel's timeline, or is it ongoing?
- Which game moments become actual chapter artifacts vs. referenced in Alan's notes?

## Notes on Using Game Transcripts

When including game transcripts as artifacts:

1. **Format:** Speaker labels, timestamps optional, dice rolls in brackets, cross-talk captured
2. **Voice:** Players slip between character voice and player voice—"Taveth says—no wait, can I ready an action first?"
3. **Interruptions:** Real conversation has interruptions, laughter, side comments
4. **The Meta Layer:** Sometimes they're clearly talking about Marble Porch through the fiction. Don't make it too on-the-nose. Trust the reader.

**Example fragment:**
```
DM: The village elder looks at Taveth. "You could stop them. The loggers.
    You have the power. Why won't you help us?"

MERI (as Taveth): "You invited them. You signed the contract."

WHIT: Oof.

DECLAN: She's not wrong, though. They did sign.

WHIT: They signed because they were desperate. That doesn't make it—

MERI: It makes it their choice. Choices have consequences.

ALAN: [long pause] Can I... is there a third option? Something that
      isn't "help them" or "let them suffer"?

DM: [quiet] There's always a third option, Alan. You just have to
    decide what you're willing to pay for it.

[Silence. Dice rolling in someone's hand, not thrown.]
```
