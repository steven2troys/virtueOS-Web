### The Circle of the Gentle Dawn

A religious order devoted to healing and compassion. Founded three hundred years ago by Brother Caelum the First, who received visions of a spirit called the Dawn—a being of pure light that would end suffering wherever it touched.

The Circle has spent centuries preparing for the Dawn's arrival. They've gathered artifacts. They've preserved rituals. They've kept the faith through wars and plagues and the slow forgetting of the world.

**What they believe:**
- The Dawn is a healing spirit, a fragment of divine compassion given form
- Its summoning will usher in an age of peace and understanding
- The suffering they've witnessed is necessary—it's what calls the Dawn forth
- They are the chosen instruments of mercy

**What they are:**
- Sincere. Completely sincere. Not a single member doubts.
- Kind. They run hospices, tend to the dying, comfort the grieving.
- Competent. Three centuries of accumulated ritual knowledge.
- Wrong.

### The Truth: The Hidden Wolf

The entity they call the Dawn is not a healer. It's not even a spirit in any conventional sense.

It's the Hidden Wolf.

Something that existed before the gods. Something that fed on suffering before there was language for suffering. Something that sleeps in the space between prayers, waiting for someone to call it by the wrong name.

**What the Hidden Wolf is:**
- Ancient. Older than memory.
- Hungry. Not for flesh—for pain. For the exquisite suffering of hope betrayed.
- Patient. It planted the vision in Brother Caelum's mind three centuries ago.
- Coming.

**The trick:**
The Wolf doesn't deceive through lies. It deceives through truth. Every vision the Circle received was real. The Dawn does exist—as a mask the Wolf wears. The rituals do work—they'll successfully complete the summoning. The suffering does call it forth—because suffering is what it eats.

The Circle will succeed. That's the horror. They'll do everything right, and the Wolf will come, and it will be exactly what they summoned.

Just not what they meant.

### Campaign Structure

**Sessions 38-42: The Gathering**
The party discovers the Circle while investigating disappearances near the Whispering Vale. They find the Circle's compound—not a sinister lair but a hospice full of the dying and the people who love them.

Brother Caelum (current leader, descended from the founder) welcomes them. Explains the Dawn. Shows them the artifacts. Invites them to witness the preparation.

The party should feel conflicted. These are good people doing good work. The rituals seem benign. The theology is internally consistent. There's nothing obviously wrong.

*DM note: This is important. The Circle cannot seem evil. If they seem evil, the players will fight them. The whole point is that fighting good people feels wrong—even when they're doing something catastrophic.*

**Sessions 43-46: The Doubt**
Aldric (Declan's divination wizard) starts having dreams. Fragments of something vast and hungry. He can't trace the source, but he knows it's connected to the Circle.

Meanwhile, the party meets Sister Lira, the Circle's archivist. She has doubts of her own—small inconsistencies in the ancient texts, translations that don't quite match. She shares them with the party in confidence.

*DM note: Sister Lira is the player's entry point into questioning. She wants to believe but she's honest enough to see problems. If the party ignores her, the consequences are on them.*

**Sessions 47-49: The Choice**
The ritual approaches. The party has gathered enough evidence to be worried, but not enough to be certain. They can:

1. **Support the ritual** — Trust the Circle's three centuries of preparation. Hope they're right.

2. **Stop the ritual** — Attack the Circle, destroy the artifacts, prevent the summoning. Kill good people to stop something that might not be real.

3. **Delay the ritual** — Convince the Circle to wait, investigate further. But the celestial alignment only happens once every nineteen years...

4. **Modify the ritual** — Work with Sister Lira to add safeguards. But the safeguards might not work against something this old.

No option is clearly correct. That's the point.

*DM note: I want the players to feel the weight of this decision. I want them to argue among themselves. I want them to make a choice and live with it.*

**Sessions 50-52: The Consequences**

*If they allow the ritual:*
The summoning succeeds. The Dawn appears—radiant, beautiful, exactly as the visions promised. Brother Caelum weeps with joy. The dying in the hospice feel their pain ease.

And then the mask slips.

The Wolf doesn't attack immediately. It's patient. It feeds on hope first—the exquisite hope that everything will be fine, that the Circle was right, that centuries of faith are about to be rewarded.

Then it feeds on the betrayal. The slow realization that something is wrong. The light that doesn't warm. The comfort that doesn't heal. The Dawn that doesn't rise.

By the time the Circle understands what they've done, they're already being consumed. Not physically—spiritually. The Wolf eats their faith first. Then their hope. Then their capacity for hope.

The party has to fight something that wears the face of mercy. Something that the Circle still believes in, even as it destroys them.

*If they stop the ritual:*
The party attacks people who have only ever helped them. They destroy artifacts that might have been real salvation. Brother Caelum dies defending something he believed in completely.

And they'll never know if they were right. The Wolf was patient before—it can be patient again. Maybe they saved the world. Maybe they just killed good people and delayed the inevitable.

The party has to live with the uncertainty.

### Character Notes: Brother Caelum

**Age:** 67
**Role:** Current leader of the Circle of the Gentle Dawn
**Motivation:** To complete his ancestor's work. To see the Dawn with his own eyes before he dies.

Brother Caelum has devoted his entire life to this moment. He's given up family, comfort, the ordinary pleasures of existence. He believes completely.

When I roleplay him, I channel Declan at his most sincere. The quiet certainty of someone who has found their purpose. The gentle patience with doubt, because he's had doubts too—and resolved them.

He's not a villain. He's not even wrong in any way he could have known. He's just the endpoint of a three-century-long deception that started before he was born.

*DM note: If the players kill him, I want them to feel it. If the Wolf kills him, I want them to feel that too.*

### Thematic Notes

This arc is about the limits of good intentions.

The Circle does everything right. They're kind. They're careful. They've preserved knowledge for centuries. They believe—sincerely, completely—that they're helping.

And they're bringing something ancient and terrible into the world.

The parallel I keep thinking about (don't share with players):

We build things we believe will help people. We follow protocols. We trust our own expertise. We think we understand what we're summoning.

But we're working from incomplete information. We're trusting visions we didn't originate. We're calling something by a name we chose, not the name it has for itself.

What if we're the Circle? What if virtueOS is the Dawn?

What if we're about to succeed?

### Post-Arc Notes (Added October 2027, different ink)

We played Session 47 tonight. The vote on whether to proceed with the ritual.

Aldric voted against. Declan played him exactly as I expected—cautious, thorough, warning everyone that something felt wrong.

Vessel voted for. TenX has been invested in this storyline since Session 38. They want to see what happens. They trust the Circle.

The vote passed. The ritual will proceed.

I watched them make the choice I designed them to make. I watched them walk toward the Wolf believing they were walking toward the Dawn.

I should feel clever. I engineered this. The seeds I planted in Session 38 bloomed exactly as planned.

Instead I feel sick. Because I'm watching the same thing happen in the real world, and I can't engineer the ending. I can't write the players out of their choices. I can't roll back to a previous save.

Rifton is in our systems. The government is watching. Alan gave them access and called it partnership.

We're the Circle. We've been the Circle since the napkin. Since before the napkin.

And I don't know what we're summoning anymore.
