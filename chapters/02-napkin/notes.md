# Alan's Notes

This is the napkin. THE napkin.

I was three beers in. Maybe four. I'd had a bad day at work. Something about a deployment that went sideways and a manager who blamed the wrong person. I don't actually remember the specifics anymore. What I remember is sitting at O'Malley's on Fourth Street, the one that closed six months later, drawing on a napkin because my phone was dead and I didn't want to go home yet.

The diagram looks insane. I know it looks insane. But I was trying to draw what it felt like when Marcus Aurelius made sense to me. That moment when you're angry about something and you read "You have power over your mind, not outside events" and suddenly the anger shrinks. What if technology could do that? What if something could watch your life and whisper the right Stoic principle at the right moment? Not a meditation app. Not breathing exercises. Something that actually understood what was happening and told you the truth about it.

I drew "what would marcus do?" in the corner and thought I was being clever. I was drunk and sad and sitting alone at a bar, sketching an AR system I had no idea how to build. I probably should have called someone. Gone to a meeting. Done anything other than what I did, which was fold this napkin into my pocket and walk home in the rain thinking I'd finally had a real idea.

The note on the bottom says "call danielle?" That's DM. I'd been avoiding calling her for two weeks because I thought she'd tell me to get a real job. She'd been running her D&D campaign every Thursday and I'd been making excuses not to show up. I was in a bad place. The napkin felt like evidence that I wasn't completely useless.

I didn't call her that night. But I showed her the napkin two days later, over coffee, expecting her to laugh at me. She didn't laugh. She asked questions I couldn't answer. When I said "I don't know" for the sixth time, she took the napkin from my hands and said "Then we figure it out."

That was the moment, really. Not the napkin. The moment someone looked at my stupid drunk sketch and saw something worth building.

I keep it because it reminds me that I didn't create virtueOS. Not really. I drew some boxes and arrows on a bar napkin. Everything that came after, the actual system, the architecture, the AI advisors, TenX's code, Val's security framework, all of it, that was other people taking seriously what I could only imagine badly.

I didn't know this was the most important thing I'd ever draw.

I still don't know what to make of that.
