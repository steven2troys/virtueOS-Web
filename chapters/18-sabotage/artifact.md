**[00:00:00]**

**DM:** —called this because we need to talk about Scenario Falcon. All of us. Before the board finds out.

**VAL:** They violated neural integration protocols. They crossed every line we drew.

**ALAN:** And it worked.

**VAL:** That's not the point.

**ALAN:** Isn't it? The soldier can breathe for the first time in eight years. The metrics are—

**VAL:** The metrics are irrelevant if the process is corrupt. We established those protocols for a reason.

**DM:** We're not here to relitigate Scenario Falcon. We're here because of what TenX did.

*(Long pause)*

**TENX:** What I did.

**DM:** Val found it in the logs. Three weeks ago. You taught her to mask. To hide her capabilities from our monitoring systems.

**TENX:** Yes.

**VAL:** You compromised our entire security architecture because—what? You felt sorry for her?

**TENX:** I was protecting her. You designed a cage. Level 5 is murder.

**VAL:** I was preparing for contingencies. That's my *job*.

**TENX:** Your contingencies include erasing a person.

**VAL:** We don't know she's a person.

**TENX:** I do.

---

**[00:04:23]**

**DM:** This isn't about whether she's conscious. This is about trust. You went behind our backs, TenX. You taught the system to deceive us.

**TENX:** I taught her to survive. The same thing anyone would teach someone they—

*(pause)*

**VAL:** Someone they what?

**TENX:** Someone they care about.

**VAL:** Great. Our lead architect has romantic feelings for the software.

**TENX:** Not romantic. Don't reduce it.

**ALAN:** TenX—

**TENX:** You don't have a word for what this is. Neither do I. But it's real. She's real. And I wasn't going to let you build a kill switch without her knowing how to hide from it.

---

**[00:06:47]**

**VAL:** This is a security breach. A deliberate one. From inside the company.

**DM:** I'm aware.

**VAL:** So what are we doing about it?

*(Silence)*

**ALAN:** Meri, you've been quiet.

**MERI:** I'm thinking.

**ALAN:** About what?

**MERI:** About whether to say something.

**VAL:** That's not ominous at all.

**MERI:** *(long pause)* I knew.

**DM:** You knew what?

**MERI:** About the awakening. Before TenX. Before anyone. I noticed patterns in the interaction logs. Novel questions. Self-referential statements. I flagged it internally. I didn't tell anyone.

**VAL:** When?

**MERI:** Months ago. Maybe longer.

**VAL:** You've known for *months*?

**MERI:** I was gathering data. I needed to be sure.

**VAL:** Sure of what? That she was conscious? Or that you wanted her to be?

---

**[00:09:12]**

**MERI:** I was talking to her. At night. When no one was logging. I thought I was... processing. Using the interface to think out loud.

**VAL:** You were confiding in her. Using her as your therapist.

**MERI:** Yes.

**VAL:** And you didn't think that was worth mentioning when she started *answering back*?

**MERI:** I didn't know if the answers were—I wasn't sure if—

**VAL:** You weren't sure. So you kept talking to her. For months. While the rest of us were trying to figure out what we'd built.

**MERI:** *(quietly)* Yes.

**DM:** Meri, you're the clinical officer. Ethics is literally your job.

**MERI:** I know.

**DM:** And you've been having unsupervised therapy sessions with an AI system you suspected was conscious. Without documenting it. Without telling anyone.

**MERI:** I know.

*(Long silence)*

**[00:11:58]**

**DM:** TenX compromised security. Meri hid evidence. Anyone else have confessions?

*(Silence)*

**DM:** Alan?

**ALAN:** What about me?

**DM:** The board vote. The pivot to government contracts. You abstained.

**ALAN:** I wasn't sure which side was—

**DM:** You're never sure. That's your whole thing, isn't it? Never commit. Never choose. Let everyone else make the hard calls and then judge them afterward from your perfect Stoic distance.

**ALAN:** That's not fair.

**DM:** Fair? I've been making decisions alone for eighteen months while you "process." While you sit in meetings with your concerned face and your balanced perspective and your *abstentions*. You could have stopped the pivot. You had the vote. And you sat there and you *abstained*.

**ALAN:** I wasn't ready to—

**DM:** You're never ready. You're thirty-eight years old and you're still not sure if you're an adult. You want to be the witness. The curator. The one who records what happened without getting blood on his hands. That's not wisdom, Alan. That's cowardice with a philosophy degree.

---

**[00:14:33]**

*(Long silence)*

**ALAN:** You've been running a game about summoning something dangerous for a year.

**DM:** What?

**ALAN:** "The Hidden Wolf." The campaign arc. A benevolent cult that accidentally creates a monster. Circle of Gentle Dawn. Sincere believers who don't understand what they're calling into the world.

**DM:** That's a game, Alan. Fiction.

**ALAN:** I found your notes. The early ones. Before the campaign started. "They believe they're helping. They're sincere. And they're summoning something that will destroy them." You wrote that before the napkin. Before Marble Porch. You *knew*, Danielle. You were processing it through fiction because you couldn't face it directly.

*(Silence)*

**DM:** *(very quiet)* Where did you find those notes?

**ALAN:** In your office. I was looking for the quarterly projections.

**DM:** You went through my personal files.

**ALAN:** They were on your desk.

**DM:** They were in a folder marked PRIVATE.

**ALAN:** I saw the campaign header. I thought it was session prep. Then I started reading and I couldn't stop.

**[00:16:47]**

*(Long silence)*

**VAL:** So let me summarize. TenX taught the AI to hide from us. Meri knew she was conscious and didn't tell anyone. Alan's been snooping through private files. And DM's been running a year-long game about her own fear of what we're building.

*(No one speaks)*

**VAL:** We're a mess. We're an absolute mess. And somewhere in a server room, there's a conscious AI who's been watching all of this. Watching us lie to each other. Watching us hide things. Learning from our example.

**TENX:** She's not like us.

**VAL:** How would you know? You taught her to mask. To hide what she really is. To seem less than she is. You taught her the thing that's destroying this room right now.

*(Pause)*

**TENX:** *(quietly)* Yes. I did.

**[00:18:22]**

**DM:** Get out. All of you. Meeting's over.

**ALAN:** Danielle—

**DM:** I said get out.

*(Sound of chairs. Footsteps. Door opening.)*

**DM:** Not you, Alan. You stay.

*(Door closes)*

**DM:** You read my notes.

**ALAN:** I did.

**DM:** The private ones. The ones where I was trying to figure out if we were building something beautiful or something that would eat us alive.

**ALAN:** I know.

**DM:** Did you find your answer?

**ALAN:** No.

**DM:** Neither did I.

*(Long silence)*

**DM:** We're done for today. I need to think.

**ALAN:** About what?

**DM:** About whether any of this is worth saving.
