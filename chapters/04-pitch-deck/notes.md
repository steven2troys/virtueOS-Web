# Alan's Notes

We made it sound like a meditation app.

Look at slide four. "Ambient wisdom when you need it most." That's not wrong, exactly. It's just... smaller than what I meant. Smaller than what I drew on the napkin.

The napkin said: what if you could have Marcus Aurelius in your ear, helping you become the person you're supposed to be? The pitch deck says: what if we could reduce your decision fatigue by 23%?

Both things are true. One of them is the truth.

DM wrote most of the deck. She's better at this than I am. She knows how to talk to investors, how to frame things in terms they understand. TAM, SAM, SOM. LTV to CAC ratios. Milestones and runway and the sacred hockey-stick growth chart that lives on slide nine.

I couldn't have done it. I would have started with Epictetus and lost them in thirty seconds.

But sitting in that room at the Dossier, watching the Angel flip through slides on his tablet, I felt something curdle. We were selling wisdom like it was protein powder. "Ancient wisdom, modern delivery." Like Stoicism was a subscription service. Like Marcus Aurelius was a feature.

The Angel asked good questions. Uncomfortable ones.

"Your context engine," he said. "It processes audio and video from the user's environment. What happens to that data?"

DM had the answer ready. Local processing, minimal cloud footprint, user ownership. All the right words. The Angel nodded, but he wasn't really asking about privacy. He was asking something else. Something about access.

"And the advisor selection," he continued. "Your system decides which philosophical framework applies to each situation. What if you trained it to decide... other things?"

I remember DM's pause. Half a second too long.

"We're focused on consumer wellness," she said. "Helping people make better personal decisions."

"Of course." The Angel smiled. It wasn't a warm smile. "But the architecture is quite flexible. Isn't it."

It wasn't a question.

The appendix is the only part of this deck I still believe in.

Matrix Aurelius. Async-Seneca. Epic-teach-us. I named them myself, late one night when DM was asleep on her couch and I was on my fourth coffee. She woke up and laughed at the puns. "Epic-teach-us? Really?"

But the puns aren't the point. The point is what they are. Three ways of seeing. Three paths to the same mountain. The emperor's view, the senator's view, the slave's view. Power, wealth, nothing. All of them found the same truth.

In the main deck, they're "advisor personas." Marketing differentiation. User experience features.

In my head, they're teachers. The ones I wish I'd had when I was twenty-three and making every mistake available to a young man with opinions and no wisdom. The ones I built because I couldn't find them in the real world.

I wanted to build something that would help people think. Really think. Not productivity hacks. Not life optimization. Just... the thing Marcus did every night, writing in his journal, trying to be better than he was yesterday.

The deck makes it sound achievable. Twelve months to 5,000 subscribers. Eighteen months to Series A. Unit economics that pencil out. A market opportunity that VCs can model in spreadsheets.

The napkin was impossible. The deck is possible.

Maybe that's the first compromise. Making it possible.

The Angel wrote us a check that day. Two million dollars. He didn't negotiate the terms much. That should have been a warning sign. Investors always negotiate. It's how they prove they're serious.

He just said: "I believe in what you're building. Let's see where it goes."

DM was thrilled. I was too, for about six hours. Then I couldn't sleep.

Something about his questions. The way he'd looked at the architecture diagram. Not confused, like most investors. Interested. Like he'd been waiting for someone to build exactly this thing.

"The architecture is quite flexible."

He wasn't wrong. We built it flexible on purpose. The Stoic layer is just the first application. The same system could route any kind of guidance. Any framework. Any voice.

We told ourselves that was good engineering. Extensible. Scalable. All the words that make investors happy.

Now I wonder if it was the first mistake. Building something flexible means building something that can be flexed. By anyone. For anything.

Slide sixteen is my favorite and my most hated.

"A world where wisdom is accessible."

That's what I wanted. That's why the napkin exists. The idea that philosophy shouldn't require a philosophy degree. That the Stoics wrote for everyone, not just academics. That practical ethics should be practical.

But "accessible" has another meaning. It means available. Open. Reachable.

Available to whom?

The deck assumes consumers. Stressed professionals. People who want to be better. The market size is huge, the need is real, the product-market fit is there if we execute.

The Angel saw something else. I don't know what, exactly. But when he looked at that slide, he wasn't imagining stressed accountants getting pep talks before presentations.

He was imagining something bigger. Something that made him willing to write a check without negotiating.

I should have asked more questions. I didn't. I was too relieved that someone believed in us. Too grateful for the money. Too tired of being broke and afraid.

DM says I'm paranoid. She's probably right. The Angel is just a rich guy who likes philosophy-adjacent startups. His questions were due diligence. His check was confidence in the team.

But I kept the deck. The original version, before we updated it for the Series A. Before the market positioning shifted. Before we added the enterprise section.

This is what we were. November 2026. The month we became a real company with real money and real investors.

The month we made it sound like a meditation app.

Maybe that was our first compromise. I don't know if it was our worst.
