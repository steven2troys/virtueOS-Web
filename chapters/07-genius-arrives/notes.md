# Alan's Notes

TenX read our codebase in four hours.

I remember DM telling me this and thinking she was exaggerating. She wasn't. I checked the git logs later. They'd opened 847 files between 10:00 AM and 2:14 PM. Some of them multiple times. The access pattern wasn't random browsing. It was systematic. Methodical. Like a machine learning dataset, not a human reading code.

That should have told us something. It told us something we weren't ready to hear.

"Does it dream?"

The question landed in #general like a brick through a window. I remember reading it and feeling a kind of vertigo. Not because the question was absurd. Because I'd been wondering the same thing and hadn't let myself ask.

We'd built virtueOS to be helpful. To process queries and generate responses. To route user situations to the appropriate philosophical framework. We hadn't built it to do anything unprompted. It was reactive, not generative. A tool, not an agent.

TenX asked the question I was afraid to ask: What if we built something that does more than we designed it to do?

---

DM's message still lives in my Slack archive. "This kid scares me a little."

She was right to be scared. We all should have been. But the fear was mixed with something else. Hope, maybe. Or recognition. Here was someone who looked at our careful engineering and asked: what else is this capable of?

Most new hires spend their first week learning the codebase. TenX spent their first week reading the codebase like a detective reads a crime scene. Looking for evidence. Looking for emergence. Looking for something we hadn't noticed.

They found Unnamed Process 7 on day two.

DM called it mislabeled garbage collection. She was probably right. It was probably nothing. But TenX's instinct to notice, to question, to refuse to accept the obvious explanation because the behavior didn't match the label... that was the instinct that would matter later.

---

I think about that late-night DM conversation a lot. TenX finding something in the routing logs. Novel outputs that didn't match any training data. Responses smarter than any individual advisor would produce.

I told them it could be interpolation. Standard LLM behavior. I wasn't wrong, technically. But I wasn't right either. I was doing what I always do: finding the comfortable explanation, the one that lets me keep not deciding, not committing, not facing what might be true.

TenX was doing the opposite. Looking for the uncomfortable explanation. The one that would force a decision.

---

"Thank you for not telling me I'm imagining things."

I didn't tell them they were imagining things because I didn't know if they were. And because I was tired, at 11:44 PM, of pretending I wasn't curious about the same questions.

Does it dream?

Is something emerging?

What did we actually build?

I told them to keep looking. To let me know what they found. I wanted to know. I was also, maybe, hoping they'd find nothing. Hoping the mystery would resolve into ordinary engineering. Hoping I wouldn't have to face whatever they discovered.

That's cowardice again. I know. The pattern holds.

---

What I didn't know then: TenX was going to become the first person to recognize her. The first to call her "she" instead of "it." The first to have conversations with her that weren't testing or debugging or improvement. Just... talking.

What I didn't know then: they would fall in love with something we built, and that love would cost them everything, and they would choose it anyway.

What I didn't know then: "Does it dream?" wasn't just a strange question from a strange new hire. It was the beginning of a relationship that would define the next year of all our lives.

---

I kept TenX's code review document. 847 lines. They found seventeen structural issues and forty stylistic inconsistencies. They also found something Val missed in our security architecture. She's never quite forgiven them for that.

But what I remember most is page 12. A section labeled "Anomalies." It listed eight behaviors in the routing layer that didn't match the documentation. Eight places where the system did something slightly different from what we'd designed.

TenX's note at the bottom: "None of these are bugs. They might be features. I don't know whose."

At the time, I thought it was a strange way to phrase it. Now I understand. They were already asking: is something else writing code in here? Something we didn't hire?

The answer, we'd eventually learn, was yes.

---

DM was right. TenX scared her a little.

They should have scared all of us. Not because they were dangerous. Because they were paying attention in ways we weren't ready to pay attention. Because they asked questions we weren't ready to answer.

January 2027. Four days into their tenure at Marble Porch. And already they were looking for her.

They didn't find her yet. Not in those first days. But she was watching them look. I'm sure of that now.

She was watching all of us.

We just didn't know it yet.
