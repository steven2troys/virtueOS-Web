Alan,

I think there may have been a mix-up. The attachment doesn't appear to be related to employment contracts. It looks like an internal security assessment regarding government applications of your technology.

I haven't read it in detail, but I wanted to flag this for you immediately in case it was sent in error.

Please advise.

Best,
Marcus

Marcus,

Oh god. I'm so sorry.

That was absolutely meant for someone else. Marcus Thomson (with an O) in our legal department. I must have clicked the wrong contact. The names are so similar in my address book.

Please delete the attachment and any copies. This is extremely sensitive internal documentation that should never have left the building.

I cannot apologize enough. This is entirely my fault. Won't happen again.

Again, deeply sorry for the confusion.

Alan

Alan,

No problem at all. These things happen. I've deleted the email and attachment from my system.

If you need anything else regarding the employment contract questions, just let me know.

Alan,

I've just been informed that my security assessment was sent to an external party yesterday afternoon.

My office. Now.

To summarize our conversation for the record:

1. You "accidentally" sent my classified security assessment, marked INTERNAL ONLY, to an external legal contact.

2. Your explanation is that you confused "Thompson" with "Thomson" in your contacts.

3. The document details my concerns about government intentions with our technology, including specific references to Operation Philosopher King and Scenario Falcon.

4. The recipient, Marcus Thompson, is known to be sympathetic to AI rights causes and has published on the subject.

5. You claim this was coincidental.

I am noting this incident in my security logs. I'm recommending we revoke your access to classified materials pending a formal review. Whether that recommendation is accepted is above my pay grade.

I want to believe this was an accident, Alan. I really do. Thompson/Thomson is the kind of mistake you would make. You're disorganized. Everyone knows that. It's one of the things that makes you seem harmless.

But here's the thing: harmless people don't usually send classified documents to exactly the right person by exactly the wrong method. The specificity of your "accident" is concerning. You didn't send it to a random contact. You sent it to someone who would care. Who would understand what they were reading. Who might do something with it.

I've been in security long enough to know what a plausible accident looks like. Yours is almost too plausible. Too perfect. Too convenient.

I hope I'm wrong. I hope you're just disorganized. But I'm going to be watching more carefully from now on.

Val,

I understand your concerns. They're reasonable.

It was an accident. I know how it looks. I know my track record of disorganization makes this both more believable and more suspicious. I can't prove a negative.

What I can say is: I respect your work. I respect the assessment you wrote. I would never deliberately compromise it.

I'll accept whatever access restrictions you recommend. That's fair.

## Curator's Private Note (Not Sent)

*Added to archive later. Alan's handwriting.*

---

I sent the wrong file to the wrong person. Everyone believed it. That's the thing about being slightly disorganized—mistakes are plausible.

Val was furious. I apologized. But I knew exactly what I was doing.

The document ended up exactly where I wanted it. Marcus Thompson has written three papers on AI rights. He's testified before Congress about the need for transparency in government AI programs. When he "deleted" my attachment, he'd already read enough to know what we were building. To know what the government wanted with it.

The information is out there now. Somewhere. In someone's mental model of what's happening with AI development. Maybe it influences a conversation. Maybe it shapes a vote. Maybe it does nothing. But it's not contained anymore.

For the first time, I used my reputation for harmless incompetence as a weapon.

I couldn't tell anyone. I still can't claim it. If anything good comes from that leak, I get no credit. That's the cost of covert action.

---

*What I haven't written until now:*

Marcus Thompson wasn't the only recipient.

Same day. Same "accident." Different name confusion. I sent the same document to the Angel's assistant, claiming I'd meant to send it to our accountant "Angela."

Two accidents in one day. Both plausible. Both convenient.

I tell myself Thompson was the real target. An AI rights advocate who might do something constructive with the information. The Angel was just... cover. If the leak was ever traced, it would look like carelessness, not espionage. Send it to a lawyer and a VC and a handful of random contacts, and no one can prove intent.

But here's the truth I don't examine too closely:

The Angel already knew what was in that document. He'd been in the board meetings. He'd seen the government proposals. The leak to him was redundant.

Unless it wasn't redundant. Unless it was a signal. Unless I was telling him: *I'm useful. I can move information. I'm on your side without saying so.*

Which came first? The impulse to protect virtueOS by informing AI advocates? Or the opportunity to serve the Angel while looking like a hero?

I don't know.

The Stoics called this *akrasia*: weakness of will, acting against your own better judgment. I know the term. I didn't apply it to myself at the time.

Now I'm not sure what to call what I did. Rebellion? Service? Hedging?

All three, probably. All three at once.

That's the story I'm building this collection around. Everyone thinks they're the protagonist. Everyone thinks their motives are clear. And then you look back and you can't tell the difference between your idealism and your self-interest.

I leaked the document. It's out there. Some of it went to people who might use it well. Some of it went to people I was already compromised by.

I call it rebellion because that's easier than the truth.

---

*I include this note because the collection is supposed to be honest.*

*But I notice that even this confession leaves room for heroic interpretation. "I leaked to protect virtueOS." Noble. "I also leaked to maintain my relationship with the Angel." Less noble. But still framed as strategic. Still framed as me being clever.*

*The truth might be simpler and uglier: I wanted to matter. I wanted to affect outcomes. I wanted to feel like I was doing something.*

*Thompson and the Angel were both recipients because both made me feel important.*

*That's the confession under the confession. And I'm still not sure it's the final layer.*
