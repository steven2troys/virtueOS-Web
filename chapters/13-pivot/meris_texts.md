# Text Messages: Meri to Susan
## Evening of September 14, 2027

---

**6:47 PM**

**Meri:** The board voted for government work. I voted against. It passed anyway.

**Susan:** So you lost?

**Meri:** I don't know yet. Maybe we all lost. The thing I've been building—the thing that's supposed to help people—might end up in interrogation rooms. Or military psych wards. Or both.

**Susan:** Can you stop it?

**Meri:** I don't think so. I can stay and try to make it less bad. Or I can leave and let it happen without me.

**6:52 PM**

**Susan:** The rot speech again?

**Meri:** You know me too well.

**Susan:** I know you'll stay. You always stay. I'll leave a drink out.

**Meri:** Make it a double.

---

**7:14 PM**

**Susan:** You still at the office?

**Meri:** Parking lot. Can't make myself drive yet.

**Susan:** What happened after the vote?

**Meri:** Alan didn't say anything. Not one word. DM gave a speech about the record. Priya said she hoped she was wrong. The Angel thanked everyone for the productive discussion.

**Susan:** The Angel.

**Meri:** I know.

**Susan:** You've never told me that person's actual name.

**Meri:** I don't think anyone knows it.

**7:31 PM**

**Susan:** Come home.

**Meri:** I'm thinking about Taveth. About walking north until there's nothing left to compromise.

**Susan:** Taveth is a character. You're a person. Persons come home and drink whiskey with their partners.

**Meri:** What if I'm on the wrong side?

**Susan:** Then you're on the wrong side with good intentions and clinical oversight authority. That's better than not being there at all.

**Meri:** I don't know if that's true.

**Susan:** Neither do I. Come home anyway.

---

**7:38 PM**

**Meri:** On my way.

**Susan:** I love you.

**Meri:** Even when I'm complicit?

**Susan:** Especially then. You're only complicit in things because you care enough to be in the room.

### Curator's Note

Meri gave me these reluctantly. She said Susan was private.

I said Susan was also the reason she stayed. The person who understood the choice without needing it explained. That mattered.

She let me include it.

I notice that Susan never asked what virtueOS is, what the government contract involves, what "interrogation rooms" might mean. She asked: can you stop it? And then: come home.

Some people need to understand the whole situation before they can respond. Susan responds first and trusts the details to sort themselves out.

I think that's why Meri can do what she does. She has someone at home who doesn't need explanations. Who just knows when to pour the whiskey.
