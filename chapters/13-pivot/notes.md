# Curator's Notes: Chapter 13

## On the Minutes

Corporate minutes are designed to obscure. The language is procedural, the disputes sanitized, the actual dynamics invisible. Reading this document, you'd think a group of reasonable people had a measured debate and reached a conclusion.

That's not what happened.

## What the Minutes Don't Show

Three days before this meeting, the Angel invited me for coffee. Same place we always met. He ordered for both of us before I arrived.

"The vote is coming up," he said. "You know how it's going to go."

I knew. Lattimer and Rifton would vote for. Priya would vote against. Garrett was genuinely undecided, leaning toward whatever seemed least risky. DM and Meri would vote against on principle.

That left me.

"A 4-4 tie kills the motion," the Angel said. "You understand that. A tie means the status quo. No government contract. Eighteen months of runway, then we're having a different conversation. One where nobody has good options."

I asked him what he wanted.

"I'm not asking you to vote for it. I know you can't do that. You'd have to explain it to DM, to yourself. You couldn't live with it." He paused. "Just don't vote against it. That's all. Abstain. Step aside. Let the motion pass or fail on its merits."

Abstention is supposed to mean you have no position. That you're neutral. Recusing yourself from a decision you're too conflicted to make fairly.

I wasn't conflicted. I knew what I thought. I thought the government contract was wrong. I thought we were selling something that shouldn't be sold.

But I also knew that if I voted against, the motion would die. And if the motion died, we'd run out of money. And if we ran out of money, everything we'd built would go to whoever bought the pieces.

"The deposits will continue," the Angel said. "Regardless of how you vote. That's not a transaction. I'm just telling you what's true."

He was careful. He always was. He never said: vote this way or I'll cut you off. He just made sure I understood the landscape. Made sure I saw that the safe path led through abstention.

## What I Told Myself

I told myself I was being Stoic. The vote wasn't in my control. Other people would decide the outcome. My one vote, either way, wouldn't change the fundamental dynamics. I was practicing non-attachment.

The Stoics have a word for this kind of reasoning. *Phantasia.* A false impression. An appearance that masquerades as truth.

The vote was in my control. My voice was in my control. A 4-4 tie would have killed the motion. I had the power to make that happen. I chose not to use it.

I abstained because the Angel asked me to. Because the deposits mattered more than my principles. Because I wanted the contract to pass so I wouldn't have to face what came next.

Abstention felt like wisdom. It was cowardice with better branding.

## On Rifton

The minutes introduce Daniel Rifton as an "Independent Director" who joined the board three weeks before this vote. The timing should have been a tell. It wasn't independent. It was preparation.

I've never been able to prove the connection between the government letter in Chapter 11 and Rifton's sudden appearance on our board. But the sequence speaks for itself. The letter arrived in August. Rifton was appointed August 28th. The pivot vote happened September 14th.

Someone was choreographing this. We just couldn't see the hands.

What struck me at the meeting was how reasonable he sounded. "Nobody's talking about control. We're talking about support." The dichotomy of control. He knew the language. He'd done his homework.

DM tried to articulate why it felt wrong. "Consumers want to be better. Institutions want their people to be more useful." She was right. But Rifton had an answer for everything. The goals align. The participation is voluntary. We can address it in the contract.

He wasn't lying. He believed what he was saying. That's what made him effective.

## On Meri

Meri asked the question nobody else would ask: "When your commanding officer recommends something, how voluntary is that really?"

Rifton had an answer. He always had an answer. But Meri saw something the rest of us missed. The gap between policy and practice. The distance between what the contract says and what actually happens when a sergeant tells a private to use the resilience app.

She voted against. She didn't waver. She didn't hedge.

I think about that sometimes. How she just said what she thought and accepted the consequences. No calculation. No strategic positioning. Just: this is wrong, I won't participate.

That's what it looks like when someone actually practices what the Stoics teach.

## On DM

"I want the record to reflect that I believe this compromises our founding vision."

She said it. She voted against. She's in the minutes, on the right side.

But I watched her face during the debate. She wasn't fighting to win. She was fighting to be seen fighting. Making her case clearly enough to maintain her position, not aggressively enough to actually flip the vote.

Garrett was persuadable. I've seen DM persuade harder cases in the campaign, turning a 4-2 party decision into a unanimous choice through sheer persistence. She didn't do that here. She made her statement and let the dice fall.

I didn't understand it at the time. I thought maybe she was tired. Maybe she'd accepted the inevitable.

I found out later what was really happening. She gave me her campaign notes. The ones that show what she was actually thinking that day.

That's the next artifact.

## What I Remember Most

After the vote, Meri looked at me. Not accusingly. Just looking. Taking in who I was.

"No comment recorded."

That's what the minutes say about my response. The truth is I couldn't think of anything to say. There was nothing to say. Everyone knew what I'd done.

A 4-4 tie would have killed the motion. I could have stopped it. I didn't.

The Ethics Oversight Committee was a consolation prize. Something to make us feel like we still had control. Meri agreed to chair it. She's good at lost causes.

## The Stoic Layer

Marcus Aurelius wrote that we should ask ourselves, about any action: "Is this necessary?" And if necessary, "Is this just?"

The government contract might have been necessary for survival. I can grant that argument. But was it just?

I don't know. I still don't know. The question assumes I was making a decision based on justice. I wasn't. I was making a decision based on fear. Fear of the Angel. Fear of poverty. Fear of having to choose.

The Stoics also wrote about *proairesis*, the faculty of choice. The one thing truly in our power. I had that power in that room. I abdicated it.

Maybe the contract would have passed anyway. Maybe Garrett would have voted for it regardless. Maybe my vote didn't matter.

But I'll never know. Because I didn't cast it.

*I keep this document because it shows what I was at my worst. The version of me that let other people decide while pretending I was practicing non-attachment.*

*That's not Stoicism. That's hiding.*
