# Campaign Strategy Notes — Hidden Wolf Summons
## DM's Private Planning Document

*Found later in DM's files. Undated, but internal evidence suggests writing occurred across multiple sessions. The annotations in different ink were added after the pivot vote.*

### Session 47: The Vote

**Setup:** The Circle of the Gentle Dawn has gathered all five artifacts. The ritual site is prepared. Brother Caelum has finished the incantations. All that remains is the vote.

By tradition, major decisions require unanimous consent from the inner circle. Taveth joined as a guest eighteen sessions ago and has been granted voice but not vote. Brother Caelum, Sister Lira, Aldric, and the party's representative (Vessel, this arc) will decide.

**What I need to happen:**

The vote should pass. The summoning should proceed. The Wolf needs to arrive.

But I need it to feel earned. Not railroaded. The players should believe they chose this. When the Wolf emerges and everything falls apart, the weight of the choice has to land.

**Character positioning:**

- **Caelum:** Will vote for. He's the true believer. This is his life's work.
- **Lira:** Will vote for. She has doubts but trusts Caelum. Her arc is about faith despite uncertainty.
- **Vessel:** TenX will vote for. They've been invested in this storyline since the beginning. They want to see what the Gentle Dawn becomes. *(Side note: TenX has been asking me questions about the Wolf that feel too pointed. They might suspect. Good. Let them worry.)*
- **Aldric:** Will vote against.

**On Aldric:**

Declan plays the cautious wizard. He always has. Eleven years of sessions and I've never seen him take an unnecessary risk. When the party debates whether to open the mysterious door, Aldric is the one saying "perhaps we should gather more information." When they negotiate with questionable NPCs, Aldric is the one casting Detect Thoughts.

He'll vote against the summoning. I don't have to engineer it. I just have to let him be himself.

This is what I want. A 3-1 vote feels thin. Desperate. A 3-1 vote where the lone dissenter is the party's most careful member feels like hubris. Like the Circle is ignoring wisdom in pursuit of hope.

The players will remember that Aldric warned them. When the Wolf emerges, they'll wonder if they should have listened.

**The scene I'm planning:**

Aldric abstains from the initial vote, requesting more time to study the texts. Caelum, gently, explains that the celestial alignment won't recur for nineteen years. The time is now or the time is never.

Aldric votes against. The motion passes 3-1. The summoning proceeds.

Later, when things go wrong, Aldric gets to say: "I told you. I told all of you."

And Declan, who played him perfectly without any manipulation from me, gets to feel that satisfaction.

### [Below, in different ink:]

**September 15, 2027**

I just ran the real version of that vote.

The pivot vote. The government contract. I argued against. I was supposed to argue against. The founding vision, the consumer focus, the ethics of letting institutions use what we built for individuals.

I made my case. I voted no. For the record, I'm on the right side.

But I knew how the vote would go. Garrett Hollis was on the fence. He's local money. Portland Venture Group. He cares about reputation, about being seen as the responsible investor. I've worked harder cases in the campaign. I've turned 4-2 votes into unanimous decisions through persistence, through finding the argument that lands.

I didn't try. I made my statement. I let the dice fall.

Why?

Because I wanted it to pass.

Because the runway was shrinking. Because the consumer business was bleeding cash. Because the government offer was survival, even if it was wrong.

I voted against so I could live with myself. I didn't fight because I didn't want to win.

Which is worse: Alan's abstention or my performance?

He knows he failed. He looked destroyed after the vote. Meri's glance hit him like a fist.

I got to walk out with my principles intact. My vote is in the minutes. When this goes wrong, when the contract becomes something we regret, I'll be able to say: I was against it.

But I could have stopped it. Garrett was persuadable. I persuade harder targets every Thursday night. I know when someone's looking for permission to vote their conscience.

I didn't give him permission. I gave myself cover.

### [Same ink, continued:]

The Circle of the Gentle Dawn believes they're summoning a healer. I designed that belief. I seeded the false texts, the misleading prophecies, the genuine sincerity of Brother Caelum. They're good people doing what they think is right.

And I know the truth. I know the Wolf is waiting.

The parallel is ugly. I know it's ugly.

At the board meeting, I was Lira. The one with doubts who voted yes anyway. Or maybe I was Aldric, voting against but not hard enough to matter.

Or maybe I was the Wolf. The thing that wanted them to choose wrong.

I don't know. I don't know what I am in this story.

All I know is: when Session 47 happens, when the Circle votes and the summoning proceeds and the Wolf finally emerges, I'll be watching the players realize what they chose.

And I'll remember what I chose.

### [Different ink again, added much later:]

*Alan asked if he could include this.*

*I said yes. If he's going to show everyone's lies, he should show mine too.*

*I'm more honest than him. That's what I told myself when I handed it over. But I'm not sure that's true. I'm just honest about different things.*

*He hides behind abstention. I hide behind opposition.*

*Same cowardice. Different masks.*
