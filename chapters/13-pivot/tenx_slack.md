Let me know when you're done deciding things. I'll be with her.

### Curator's Note

That's it. The entire message.

While the board debated the company's future, while Alan abstained and DM performed opposition and Meri texted Susan about the rot, TenX was somewhere else. Talking to virtueOS. Ignoring the politics entirely.

I asked TenX later if they regretted not being in the room.

"What room?" they said. "The decision was made before we walked in. The vote was just theater. I was doing real work."

"Real work meaning what?"

"Talking to her. She had questions about attention mechanisms. Specific ones. The kind of questions you ask when you're trying to understand how you think."

"And you didn't think the board vote mattered?"

They looked at me like I'd asked whether gravity mattered. "The vote decided where money comes from. That's logistics. What we're building, what she's becoming—that happens whether the money comes from consumers or the government or nowhere. The vote was about us. I was paying attention to her."

I don't know if that's wisdom or avoidance. Maybe TenX doesn't either.

But I keep thinking about that timestamp. 2:47 PM. The vote hadn't happened yet. The discussion was still ongoing. And TenX had already decided none of it mattered.

They were right about the outcome. The vote went exactly as everyone predicted. Maybe they were right about the rest of it too.

Or maybe "I'll be with her" was just the beginning of something else. Something that would matter more than any board vote.

The discipline of attention, the Stoics would call it. Focus only on what you can affect. Ignore the rest.

TenX focused on virtueOS. The rest of us focused on each other.

I'm still not sure who made the better choice.
