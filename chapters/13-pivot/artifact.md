### Call to Order

The Chair called the meeting to order at 2:03 PM and confirmed quorum.

The Chair noted the addition of Col. (Ret.) Daniel Rifton to the Board as Independent Director, effective August 28, 2027. Mr. Rifton was welcomed. Mr. Rifton thanked the Board for the opportunity and stated his interest in "ensuring responsible development of promising technologies."

### Item 1: Review of Strategic Options

The Chair presented three potential paths for the next funding cycle:

**Option A: Consumer Focus (Current Strategy)**
Continue B2C development of virtueOS glasses for individual consumers. Requires additional $12M runway extension. Projected break-even: Q3 2029.

**Option B: Enterprise Pivot**
License virtueOS technology to corporate wellness programs. Faster revenue. Requires de-prioritizing consumer hardware.

**Option C: Government Partnership**
Accept pending proposal from Department of Defense contractor for limited deployment in "stress-management applications" for personnel. Initial contract value: $8.4M over 18 months. Renewable.

The Chair opened the floor for discussion.

### Discussion Summary

**Mr. Lattimer** spoke in favor of Option C. Noted that Castellan Partners has "extensive experience navigating government procurement" and that the contract represents validation of virtueOS technology at the highest level. Suggested that "responsible government use" could enhance rather than compromise the company's mission.

**Ms. Sharma** expressed concern about mission drift. Asked what specific applications were envisioned. The Chair deferred to Mr. Rifton.

**Mr. Rifton** described the proposal as focused on "resilience training" for personnel in high-stress roles. Compared it to existing meditation apps used by military and first responders. Emphasized that virtueOS would remain advisory, not directive. "Nobody's talking about control. We're talking about support."

**Ms. Vance** (non-voting) requested clarification on clinical oversight. Asked whether deployed systems would be subject to the same ethical constraints as consumer product.

**Mr. Rifton:** "That's exactly what we want. Your ethical framework is what makes this attractive. We're not asking you to change what you've built. We're asking if you'd be willing to let more people benefit from it."

**Ms. Masters** argued that the consumer product should remain the priority. Noted that the company was founded to help individuals, not institutions. Expressed concern that government applications might require modifications incompatible with therapeutic use.

**The Chair:** "Have we identified specific incompatibilities?"

**Ms. Masters:** "Not specifically. But the incentive structures are different."

**The Chair:** "Different how?"

**Ms. Masters:** "Consumers want to be better. Institutions want their people to be more useful. Those aren't always the same thing."

**Mr. Rifton:** "I'd push back on that framing. The personnel who would use this technology are individuals too. They have families. They face real stress. The institution wants them healthy because healthy people make better decisions. The goals align more than you might think."

**Ms. Sharma** asked about exit clauses if ethical concerns materialized during deployment.

**Mr. Lattimer** noted that any contract would include standard termination provisions.

**Ms. Vance** asked what "stress-management applications" meant in practice.

**Mr. Rifton:** "Think of a soldier who has to decide whether a shadow is a threat or a civilian. Right now, they rely on training and instinct. What if they had a voice that reminded them to breathe, to assess the situation, to distinguish between what they can control and what they can't? The dichotomy of control. You built it. This is just a different context."

[Extended discussion of deployment parameters, data handling, and reporting requirements. Full transcript available in Appendix C.]

### Item 2: Motion on Strategic Direction

**Motion:** "The Board of Directors authorizes management to negotiate and execute a partnership agreement with the Department of Defense or its designated contractor for deployment of virtueOS technology in personnel resilience applications, subject to standard ethical review and termination provisions."

**Moved by:** Mr. Lattimer
**Seconded by:** The Chair

---

### Discussion on Motion

**Ms. Masters:** "I want the record to reflect that I believe this compromises our founding vision. We built virtueOS to help people become who they want to be. Not to help institutions get what they want from people."

**The Chair:** "Noted. Is there any evidence that these goals are in conflict in this specific case?"

**Ms. Masters:** "Not specific evidence. It's a matter of principle."

**The Chair:** "Principles matter. So does survival. We're eighteen months from insolvency on the current trajectory. This contract extends that to thirty-six months minimum. Sometimes principles require resources to defend."

**Mr. Hollis** asked whether hybrid approaches were possible. Both-and rather than either-or.

**Mr. Lattimer** confirmed that Option C did not preclude continued consumer development, though resources would necessarily shift.

**Ms. Vance** (non-voting) stated for the record: "I have concerns about how this technology might be used in contexts where the user has limited autonomy. A consumer chooses to use virtueOS. A soldier may be assigned to use it. Choice matters for therapeutic effectiveness. It also matters ethically."

**Mr. Rifton:** "I hear that. I'd note that participation in any wellness program is voluntary under current DoD policy. No one is forced to use meditation apps. This would be the same."

**Ms. Vance:** "Voluntary in theory. But when your commanding officer recommends something, how voluntary is that really?"

**Mr. Rifton:** "That's a fair question. It's also a question about institutional culture, not about the technology itself. We can address it in the contract."

[Further discussion of contract safeguards. Ms. Roswell raised data security requirements. Mr. Xanthos provided technical clarification on deployment architecture. The Chair noted that detailed terms would be subject to future review.]
