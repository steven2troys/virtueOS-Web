# Alan's Notes

We should have walked out.

I've said that to myself a hundred times since that afternoon. "We should have walked out." It's become a kind of mantra. A prayer to a past that can't hear me.

But "we" is doing a lot of work in that sentence.

DM couldn't have walked out. She didn't know there was anything to walk out from. Neither could Val. They saw an investor asking probing questions. Due diligence. The kind of skepticism that means someone's serious. They didn't know the questions had been scripted three weeks earlier in a coffee shop on Belmont.

I'm the one who should have walked out. I'm the one who knew.

I include both documents here because I promised honesty. The meeting notes are what happened. The notebook entry is why.

For months I told myself the notebook page was lost. I'd thrown it away, burned it, shredded it in the office machine at 2am. I invented a dozen scenarios where it no longer existed.

Then I found it in a shoebox with my passport and a birthday card from my mother. Just sitting there. Waiting.

---

The Angel asked about "adaptive behavioral modeling" and I explained it to him like I was explaining it fresh. Voice steady. Eye contact appropriate. I'd practiced.

What I couldn't practice was DM's reaction. The way her shoulders tightened when he asked about the flexible architecture. The way Val's hand moved toward her phone like she was cataloging the question for later analysis.

They were doing their jobs. Protecting the company. Being suspicious of a stranger.

I was the stranger they should have been suspicious of.

---

Val said "I don't trust him" on the walk back to the office. She was looking at me. I've replayed that moment so many times that I've worn grooves in it. Was she looking at me because I was walking next to her? Because she wanted my reaction? Because she already suspected something?

I don't know. I was watching a pigeon. Or pretending to.

The pigeon won the pretzel, if you're wondering. The other one gave up and flew to a windowsill. There's probably a metaphor there. I'm too tired to find it.

He knew our runway. Eleven weeks. I've never told anyone how he knew that.

He knew because I told him.

Three weeks before the meeting, coffee shop on Belmont, he asked about our financial position. "Just to understand what kind of terms would be helpful." I told him we had about eleven weeks of operating capital left. I told him DM had personal savings that could extend that. I told him Val was consulting on the side to cover her own expenses.

I gave him our vulnerabilities because he asked nicely and I was scared.

When he said "eleven weeks of runway" in the meeting, I watched DM's face. She didn't look at me. She was trying to figure out how he knew. Checking her own memory for leaks.

The leak was sitting next to her. Taking notes.

---

The Stoics have a concept called *prokopton*. The one making progress. The student who isn't wise yet but is walking toward wisdom.

I used to think I was a prokopton. Moving slowly but moving. Reading Marcus at night. Building virtueOS by day. Trying to be better than I was.

Now I think about what Marcus actually said: "Waste no more time arguing about what a good man should be. Be one."

I argued. I didn't be.

---

The term sheet arrived Friday. We signed it Monday. Two million dollars for fifteen percent of something that didn't exist yet, from a man whose name we never learned, representing interests we never verified.

Val's background check came back clean. All three referenced investments were real. The startups were real. The money was real.

What wasn't real was the story about a family office. What wasn't real was the disinterested observer who just wanted to see where things went.

I knew that. I signed anyway.

---

DM asked me once, months later, if I'd noticed anything strange about the meeting. She was reviewing our investor relationships for some board presentation. Just routine.

I said: "Strange how?"

She said: "He knew things. Things he shouldn't have known from our public materials."

I said: "Good research, I guess."

She looked at me for a long moment. Then she went back to her spreadsheet.

I don't know if she suspected. I don't know if she suspects now. We don't talk about the Angel anymore. We don't talk about a lot of things.

---

I'm including the notebook entry because leaving it out would be another kind of lie. The meeting notes without the confession are a different story. A story where I'm a victim of circumstances, an innocent founder outmaneuvered by a sophisticated investor.

That's not what happened.

What happened is: I was broke and scared, and a man offered me a way to be less broke and less scared, and I took it, and I've been taking it ever since.

The deposits still come. Monthly. Into an account I've never shown anyone. Enough to survive on if everything else falls apart.

It hasn't fallen apart yet. But reading these notes again, I think it was falling apart the whole time. I just didn't want to see it.

Seneca wrote: "It is not that we have a short time to live, but that we waste a lot of it."

I've wasted three years pretending I didn't know what I knew. Pretending the Angel was just an investor. Pretending the questions were just due diligence. Pretending I was still a prokopton, still moving toward wisdom, still trying to be good.

I wasn't moving toward anything. I was standing still and calling it philosophy.

This document is me stopping. Standing still and admitting it.

I don't know what comes after that. But at least I'm not pretending anymore.
