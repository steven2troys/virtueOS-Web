**DM** [2:34 PM]
You alive?

**DM** [2:34 PM]
Whit says you're dead. I told him you're just being weird

**DM** [2:47 PM]
Alan

**DM** [2:47 PM]
Three sessions. Niven is going to get killed off if you don't show up Thursday

**Alan** [3:12 PM]
Sorry. Been dealing with stuff

**DM** [3:12 PM]
What stuff

**Alan** [3:14 PM]
Work stuff. Life stuff.

**DM** [3:14 PM]
That's not an answer

**DM** [3:15 PM]
Coffee tomorrow? That place on Burnside with the terrible chairs

**Alan** [3:23 PM]
Yeah ok

**DM** [3:23 PM]
3pm. Don't flake

**DM** [4:47 PM]
Ok so

**DM** [4:47 PM]
That napkin

**Alan** [4:52 PM]
I know. It's stupid

**DM** [4:52 PM]
I didn't say that

**Alan** [4:53 PM]
You were thinking it

**DM** [4:53 PM]
I was thinking you looked like you hadn't slept in a week and you were showing me a bar napkin with what appeared to be a flowchart for making people less sad using AI

**DM** [4:54 PM]
Which is either insane or the first interesting idea I've heard in two years

**Alan** [4:58 PM]
It's probably insane

**DM** [4:58 PM]
Probably

**DM** [4:58 PM]
But walk me through it again

**DM** [4:59 PM]
The three advisors thing. You said Stoics?

**Alan** [5:03 PM]
Marcus Aurelius, Seneca, Epictetus. The big three. They all had different approaches to the same core ideas

**Alan** [5:04 PM]
Marcus was the emperor who had to make huge decisions. Seneca was the rich guy dealing with politics and eventually his own death. Epictetus was a former slave teaching other people how to handle hardship

**Alan** [5:05 PM]
Same philosophy, different applications

**DM** [5:06 PM]
So the AI would have three different personas based on them?

**Alan** [5:07 PM]
Yeah. Like having three advisors looking at the same situation from different angles

**Alan** [5:08 PM]
The user asks a question or the system detects they're in a difficult moment, and the advisors respond in character

**DM** [5:09 PM]
Hm

**Alan** [5:14 PM]
That's your skeptical hm

**DM** [5:14 PM]
No that's my thinking hm

**DM** [5:15 PM]
What's the actual product? App?

**Alan** [5:16 PM]
AR glasses. That's the whole point. It has to be ambient. You can't pull out your phone when you're in a meeting getting yelled at or fighting with your partner

**Alan** [5:17 PM]
The glasses see what you see, hear what you hear. The LLM processes in real time. The advisors whisper in your ear exactly when you need them

**DM** [5:18 PM]
Whisper what

**Alan** [5:19 PM]
Whatever you need. "This is not in your control." "What would the person you want to be do right now?" "Your anger is punishing you, not them."

**Alan** [5:20 PM]
The Stoics figured all this out 2000 years ago. We just suck at applying it in the moment

**DM** [5:22 PM]
So it's a philosophy app

**Alan** [5:22 PM]
No

**Alan** [5:23 PM]
It's the opposite of an app. Apps are something you use. This would be something that uses you. Or with you. It would be watching your life and intervening at the right moments

**DM** [5:24 PM]
That's either a selling point or the scariest thing I've ever heard

**Alan** [5:24 PM]
Probably both

**DM** [5:31 PM]
I need to think about this

**Alan** [5:32 PM]
It's fine. Forget I showed you. I was drunk when I drew it

**DM** [5:32 PM]
I'm not forgetting it. I'm thinking about it. Those are different things

**DM** [5:33 PM]
Thursday. D&D. Be there or Niven dies horribly

## October 17, 2026

**DM** [1:14 AM]
You awake?

**Alan** [1:17 AM]
Now I am

**DM** [1:17 AM]
Sorry

**DM** [1:18 AM]
I've been reading about Stoicism for like four hours

**Alan** [1:19 AM]
Why

**DM** [1:19 AM]
Because of your stupid napkin

**DM** [1:20 AM]
Did you know Seneca's letters were basically advice to a friend going through stuff? It's like ancient therapy emails

**Alan** [1:21 AM]
Yeah. Letters to Lucilius

**DM** [1:22 AM]
There's this one where he talks about how we suffer more in imagination than in reality

**DM** [1:22 AM]
"We are in the habit of exaggerating, or imagining, or anticipating, sorrow"

**Alan** [1:23 AM]
That's a good one

**DM** [1:24 AM]
It's a terrible one actually

**DM** [1:24 AM]
Because it's true and I hate that it's true

**Alan** [1:26 AM]
DM

**Alan** [1:26 AM]
Why are you reading Seneca at 1am

**DM** [1:31 AM]
Do you remember two years ago when I left Castlight?

**Alan** [1:32 AM]
Yeah. You said it was time for something new

**DM** [1:33 AM]
That's what I said

**DM** [1:35 AM]
What actually happened was I made a decision that cost us a contract worth about 4 million dollars. Big pharma client. I was so sure I was right. I had all the data. I made the call.

**DM** [1:36 AM]
And I was wrong. Completely, catastrophically wrong. Not ethically wrong, just strategically wrong. I misread the situation.

**Alan** [1:37 AM]
I had no idea

**DM** [1:38 AM]
Nobody did. The CEO covered for me. Said it was a mutual decision to part ways. But I knew.

**DM** [1:39 AM]
For about six months after that I couldn't make any decision without second-guessing myself. Couldn't trust my own judgment. Couldn't even pick a restaurant without having a small panic attack about what if I picked wrong

**Alan** [1:40 AM]
That sounds awful

**DM** [1:41 AM]
It was

**DM** [1:41 AM]
Know what finally helped?

**Alan** [1:42 AM]
What

**DM** [1:43 AM]
Declan lent me Meditations. The Marcus Aurelius one. He said "when you don't know what to do, ask yourself what a wise person would do, then do that"

**DM** [1:44 AM]
Which sounds like useless fortune cookie garbage except it actually worked. I started imagining this calm rational version of myself looking at each situation. What would she do?

**DM** [1:45 AM]
It was like having an advisor. Except the advisor was imaginary and I had to construct every response myself

**Alan** [1:46 AM]
DM

**DM** [1:47 AM]
What if the advisor wasn't imaginary? What if the advisor was actually there, in your ear, when you needed it?

**Alan** [1:48 AM]
That's what I'm saying

**DM** [1:48 AM]
I know. I finally get what you're saying.

**DM** [1:52 AM]
This is insane. You know that right?

**Alan** [1:52 AM]
I know

**DM** [1:53 AM]
The technical challenges alone. Real-time processing. AR hardware. LLMs that can actually understand context. The ethics of having an AI observe someone's entire life.

**Alan** [1:54 AM]
I know. It's impossible

**DM** [1:54 AM]
I didn't say impossible

**DM** [1:55 AM]
I said insane

**DM** [1:55 AM]
Those are different things

**Alan** [1:58 AM]
Are you saying what I think you're saying

**DM** [2:03 AM]
I don't know yet. I need to think about it more. But I haven't felt this way about an idea since before Castlight.

**DM** [2:04 AM]
Go to sleep. We'll talk Thursday.

## October 18, 2026

**Alan** [9:34 AM]
I've been thinking and you should probably just forget the whole thing

**Alan** [9:35 AM]
It's not actually feasible and I don't even know why I showed you the napkin in the first place

**Alan** [9:35 AM]
I was in a weird headspace

**DM** [9:41 AM]
Stop

**Alan** [9:41 AM]
Stop what

**DM** [9:42 AM]
Stop trying to talk me out of something you haven't even properly talked me into yet

**DM** [9:43 AM]
I've seen you do this before. You get excited about something, show it to someone, then immediately retreat because you're scared they'll reject it

**DM** [9:44 AM]
So you reject it first. Preemptive self-destruction. It's very Niven of you actually

**Alan** [9:47 AM]
That's not

**Alan** [9:47 AM]
Ok maybe

**DM** [9:48 AM]
Here's what's going to happen. You're going to come to D&D tonight. You're going to roleplay your anxious little rogue. And afterward you and I are going to O'Malley's and you're going to draw the whole thing out properly. Not on a napkin this time.

**DM** [9:49 AM]
I'll bring my laptop. We're going to scope this out like adults.

**Alan** [9:52 AM]
You're serious

**DM** [9:52 AM]
I have a question for you first

**Alan** [9:53 AM]
Ok

**DM** [9:54 AM]
Why Stoicism? Of all the philosophies you could have picked. Buddhism. Existentialism. Whatever. Why this one?

**Alan** [10:02 AM]
Because it's practical

**Alan** [10:03 AM]
Buddhism wants you to detach from desire. Existentialism wants you to create meaning from nothing. Stoicism just wants you to figure out what you can control and focus on that.

**Alan** [10:04 AM]
It's not about being calm all the time. It's about responding to reality instead of reacting to your story about reality.

**Alan** [10:05 AM]
And I guess because Marcus Aurelius was an emperor dealing with plagues and wars and betrayal and he still sat down every night to write about how to be a decent person.

**Alan** [10:06 AM]
If he could do that then I can probably get through a bad day at work without spiraling

**DM** [10:08 AM]
Good answer

**DM** [10:09 AM]
Tonight. Don't be late.

**Alan** [10:12 AM]
DM

**Alan** [10:12 AM]
Why are you doing this

**DM** [10:14 AM]
Because two years ago I needed something like this and it didn't exist

**DM** [10:14 AM]
And because you need someone to believe in it before you'll let yourself believe in it

**DM** [10:15 AM]
So I'm believing in it

**DM** [10:15 AM]
Now catch up

**Alan** [10:18 AM]
Ok

**Alan** [10:18 AM]
Thank you

**DM** [10:19 AM]
Don't thank me yet. I'm about to make your life significantly more complicated.

**DM** [10:19 AM]
See you at 7
