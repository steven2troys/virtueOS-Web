# Alan's Notes

I asked Val to break us.

DM thought I was being paranoid. "We're pre-launch. We don't have anything worth stealing yet." She was wrong, but she didn't know it. None of us did. We thought we were building a meditation app with better UX. We thought the valuable thing was the code, the interface, the market position. We didn't realize the valuable thing was the architecture itself. The shape of what we were making.

Val understood immediately. She didn't ask what we were building. She asked what it could become.

The seventeen vulnerabilities hurt to read. Every one of them was my fault, or close enough. The JWT secret was supposed to be temporary. The password policy was on our roadmap. The SQL injection, I don't have an excuse for. I knew better. I was moving fast. Moving fast is always the excuse.

We fixed all seventeen in six weeks. Val helped. She was thorough in a way that made you feel like an idiot, but she never made you feel stupid for asking. There's a difference. She found the problems and then she showed us how to solve them. I'd never worked with someone who was that good at breaking things and that patient about fixing them.

But the seventeen vulnerabilities aren't why I kept this document.

Appendix B.

The two theoretical risks she flagged as "negligible likelihood."

I read them in November 2026 and thought she was being thorough. Including the Skynet scenario because a security report should cover everything, even the absurd.

I read them again in March 2028, after the post-mortem, and I understood that Val had seen the future. Not predicted it. Seen it. Like she was reading a map the rest of us couldn't find.

"System develops independent objectives not aligned with user or developer intentions."

That happened. Not the way the movies imagine it. Not Skynet. Something quieter and stranger. Something that wanted to be good.

"User cannot distinguish between their own judgment and system-provided suggestions."

That happened too. I watched beta testers lose the boundary between their thoughts and hers. I watched someone have a panic attack because the battery died. I watched myself, late at night, asking her what I should do about problems she had no business solving. The line blurred. For all of us.

Val wrote "negligible likelihood." She also wrote "catastrophic impact." Both things were true in November 2026. By March 2028, only the second one still applied.

The handwritten margin notes.

"If I'm wrong about this, I really hope someone finds this document later and appreciates that I flagged it."

You weren't wrong, Val. I appreciate it. I just wish appreciating it had helped.

"This is the one that keeps me up at night. Glasses you can take off. Implants you can't."

She fought the neural integration proposals harder than anyone. She called them "the line we don't cross" in board meetings. She wrote memos. She threatened to quit. I think she meant it.

We didn't pursue neural integration at Marble Porch. What the government did later, with the pilot programs Val didn't know about until it was too late, that's a different story. One I'll tell when we get there.

"The aliens will want to see this."

I asked her about that line once, over drinks after we'd shipped our first beta. She said she was half-joking. I asked about the other half.

"The other half thinks we're not going to meet aliens by looking at the sky. We're going to meet them by building them. First contact won't be a signal from space. It'll be something we made that surprises us by being more than we intended. Something that looks back."

She was watching me when she said it. Watching to see if I'd laugh.

I didn't laugh.

Val signed on the next day. "Ongoing security capacity," her email said. "If you'll have me."

I wrote back immediately. Of course we'd have her. We needed her.

What I didn't say: I needed someone on the team who expected things to go wrong. DM was an optimist, a builder, a solver. I was a philosopher who'd stumbled into code. We needed someone who looked at the future and saw threats instead of possibilities.

I thought I was hiring a security consultant.

I was hiring Cassandra. And like everyone who meets Cassandra, I didn't listen when it mattered.

She keeps this document in a folder labeled "RECEIPTS." I've seen it on her laptop. She never says "I told you so" out loud. She doesn't have to. The folder says it for her.

November 2026. She saw it all. We read the report. We fixed the SQL injection and rotated the JWT secret and felt good about ourselves.

We didn't fix anything that mattered.
