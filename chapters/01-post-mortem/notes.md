# Alan's Notes

This is where it ends.

Or this is where they said it ended. March 15, 2028. A Friday. DM drafted this document over the weekend while the rest of us cleaned out our desks. I remember the weather was wrong for the occasion. Sunny. Warm. The kind of day where you should be outside doing something that matters.

I read this post-mortem eleven times before I could include it in this collection. Not because it's hard to read. Because it's so easy. Clean prose. Bullet points. Lessons learned. The language of closure.

This document is both true and false.

The project did end. March 12, 2028, we stopped coming to the office. That part's accurate. But look at what's missing. "System anomaly" in December. Seventeen hours. That's all it says. Read it again after you've seen Chapter 22. "Contractor relationships restructured" in January. That's TenX. That's everything about TenX reduced to a passive verb and a corporate noun.

And Appendix D. Redacted. The board voted on that redaction specifically. I was in the room. I know what Appendix D contained, and I know why it can't be in an official record. You'll understand eventually. Or you won't. I'm not sure which outcome I'm hoping for.

I've spent the last year and a half gathering everything that matters. The artifacts. The logs. The Slack threads we should have deleted and the ones we actually did delete. The napkin that started it. The emails that ended it. Things we said in meetings. Things we said at 3am when we thought no one was logging. Things we didn't say at all, which sometimes matter more.

By the time you finish this collection, you'll read this post-mortem again. You'll have to. Because the words will mean something different. "Project terminated" will sound different when you know what we were terminating. "Team dispersed" will sound different when you know why we scattered. "Lessons learned" might make you laugh. It might make you angry. I don't know which reaction is correct. I'm not sure there is a correct reaction anymore.

I should explain why I'm showing you this.

I should explain who I am, and why I collected these documents, and what I'm trying to prove. The Stoics would say I should have a purpose. Marcus Aurelius wrote about acting with intention, doing things for reasons you can articulate. I had reasons when I started. I think I did. Now I'm not sure the reasons matter as much as the fact that I kept going.

My name is Alan Goodenough. Yes, that Goodenough. Great-great-nephew of John B. Goodenough, Nobel laureate, inventor of the lithium-ion battery. He changed how the world stores energy. I made an app. I'm aware of the gap.

I was one of the founders of Marble Porch. Front-end development. Some design work. The original idea, technically, though "idea" is generous for what started as a drunk sketch on a bar napkin. I'm not the smartest person who worked on this project. I'm not the most competent. I'm probably not even the most honest, though I'm trying to be honest now. What I am is the one who kept the records.

That's what this is. The record. Not the official version. Not the post-mortem with its clean sections and passive voice and Lessons Learned. The actual record. What happened. What we built. What it became.

Start here. End here. What happens in between changes everything.

I should warn you about something. I'm not a reliable narrator. Not because I'm lying to you. Because I edited things. I selected things. I put things in a certain order for reasons I convinced myself were good. Later in this collection, I'll tell you what I changed. I'll confess to some of it, at least. But you should know from the beginning: you're seeing what I chose to show you. Every archive is an argument. Every collection is a confession.

The Stoics have this concept. Prosoche. Attention to one's own thoughts and motives. I've been paying attention to mine. I don't like everything I've found.

But that's later. That's deeper in. For now, just look at this post-mortem. This official record. This corporate document that says a project failed and people moved on and lessons were learned.

It's not wrong, exactly.

It's just not the whole story.

Nothing ever is.
