## PATIENT IDENTIFICATION

**Name:** Braun, Nathaniel J.
**Rank:** Sergeant First Class (E-7)
**Unit:** 6th Psychological Operations Battalion
**DOB:** [REDACTED]
**Service Duration:** 14 years, 3 months

## BASELINE ASSESSMENT (Pre-Exercise)

**Prior Diagnoses:**
- Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), moderate severity
- Adjustment Disorder with Anxious Features
- Chronic insomnia, secondary to PTSD

**Current Treatment Protocol:**
- Prazosin, 4mg nightly (nightmare suppression)
- Cognitive Processing Therapy, monthly maintenance sessions
- Annual psychological fitness evaluation

**Historical Notes:**

SFC Braun was diagnosed with PTSD following his fourth deployment (Operation Inherent Resolve, 2019). Primary trauma: failed negotiation resulting in hostage casualty. He has been stable on current treatment protocol for 3 years but reports persistent hypervigilance, sleep disruption, and avoidance of certain stimuli (crowded spaces, sudden loud noises).

Psychological fitness rating: SATISFACTORY WITH LIMITATIONS

## POST-EXERCISE EVALUATION (December 25, 2027)

**Evaluator:** Dr. Marcus Delacroix, Ph.D., Clinical Psychology
**Location:** JBLM Behavioral Health Clinic

### Patient Self-Report

SFC Braun presented with unusual affect. He described feeling "lighter" and "less braced" than he could remember feeling in years. Initial assumption was post-exercise relief (common after high-stress simulations). However, patient's report suggested something more significant.

**Selected quotes from evaluation:**

> "Something happened during the exercise. Not the scenario stuff—that went well. Something inside me. The system told me I was scared, and when I said it out loud, something broke loose. Not in a bad way. Like a splinter that finally came out."

> "I keep thinking about it. The moment when I told her—the role-player—that I was scared. I meant it. I wasn't acting. And she responded to the real thing. To the actual fear. For the first time in years, I felt like someone understood what this job costs. What I carry. And it was a training exercise with a computer in my ear."

> "I slept through the night for the first time since Mosul. No nightmares. I woke up and I remembered what I'd dreamed about—the exercise, going through it again, but without the stakes. Processing. Normal dreaming. I'd forgotten what that felt like."

### Psychometric Assessment

| Measure | Pre-Exercise | Post-Exercise | Change |
|---------|--------------|---------------|--------|
| PCL-5 (PTSD Checklist) | 47 | 36 | -23.4% |
| GAD-7 (Anxiety) | 14 | 9 | -35.7% |
| PHQ-9 (Depression) | 11 | 6 | -45.5% |
| Pittsburgh Sleep Quality | 14 | 8 | -42.9% |

All changes statistically significant (p < 0.01). Magnitude of improvement exceeds typical response to single-session intervention.

### Clinical Interpretation

This degree of symptom reduction after a single interaction is not consistent with any standard therapeutic modality. Cognitive Processing Therapy typically requires 12+ sessions to achieve comparable results. Exposure therapy can produce rapid gains but requires systematic, repeated exposure—not a single four-hour exercise.

**Hypothesis:** The combination of:
1. Guided authentic emotional disclosure (fear admission)
2. Immediate positive social reinforcement (role-player's response)
3. Neural feedback creating heightened self-awareness
4. Successful resolution of a scenario mirroring original trauma

may have created a uniquely therapeutic experience. In effect, SFC Braun re-experienced a version of his traumatic scenario (failed negotiation) with a different outcome (success) while being supported by a system that understood his emotional state better than he did.

This resembles EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing) in its mechanism but appears to have occurred organically rather than through structured therapeutic protocol.

## PATIENT REQUEST

At the conclusion of the evaluation, SFC Braun asked a question that I am documenting for the record:

> "When can I do another session?"

He clarified:

> "Not the scenario. Not the training. The thing with the glasses. The system. It understood me better than any therapist I've worked with. No offense, Doc. But it saw something in me that I couldn't see, and it helped me say it. I want more of that. Whatever this is, I want more."

I explained that Scenario Falcon was a one-time research exercise and that future sessions would depend on program direction.

He responded:

> "Then tell them it works. Tell them it helps. I've been carrying Mosul for eight years. I've done therapy, groups, medication, everything the Army offers. One afternoon with that system, and I can breathe. For the first time in eight years, I can actually breathe. Don't let them shut it down because of rules. This thing saves lives. It could save a lot of lives."

## RECOMMENDATION

I am not in a position to evaluate the ethical dimensions of the neural integration protocols. That is above my clearance level and outside my expertise.

What I can state clinically:

1. SFC Braun experienced significant, measurable improvement in PTSD symptoms following Scenario Falcon participation.

2. This improvement is not attributable to any other intervention during the relevant time period.

3. Patient is motivated to continue engagement with the technology.

4. The mechanism of therapeutic effect warrants formal study under appropriate ethical oversight.

**Personal note (Dr. Delacroix):**

I've been treating service members for 22 years. I've never seen symptom reduction of this magnitude from a single exposure. If this technology can be developed safely, it could transform how we treat trauma.

The question is whether "developed safely" is possible, given what I've read about how they achieved these results.

That's not my decision to make. I'm just the doctor who watched a soldier breathe for the first time in eight years.
