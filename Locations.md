## Marble Porch Headquarters

### Early Days (2026-2027): The Central Eastside
**Address:** A converted warehouse on SE Taylor Street, between the train tracks and the river.

The Central Eastside Industrial District—what locals still call "the produce district"—is where Portland startups go before they can afford the Pearl. Old brick warehouses, loading docks converted to open floor plans, rent that's merely expensive instead of absurd.

Marble Porch's first office is on the third floor of a building that still smells faintly of coffee roasting from the place downstairs. The freight elevator works most of the time. There's a view of the Willamette and the trains that run along the waterfront.

> "We couldn't afford the Pearl. We couldn't afford most of downtown. But DM found this place—third floor of a building that used to store fruit. The elevator makes a sound like it's dying every time you use it. I loved it immediately."
> — Alan's notes

### After Funding (Late 2027): The Pearl District
**Address:** A proper office on NW 13th Avenue, near Powell's Books.

When the money arrives, they move. The Pearl is where Portland pretends to be San Francisco—art galleries, exposed brick that's been sandblasted clean, rent that makes you wince. The new office has windows and working HVAC and a conference room with a door that closes.

Meri hates it. Alan is ambivalent. DM says it's necessary. Val likes the security upgrades they could finally afford.

## The Napkin Bar

### The Sandy Hut
**Address:** 1430 NE Sandy Blvd

The bar where Alan drew the napkin is the Sandy Hut—a Portland institution since 1923. Christmas lights year-round. A jukebox that still works. The kind of place where the bartender doesn't judge you for drinking alone on a Tuesday.

Alan wasn't there for atmosphere. He was there because it was close to his apartment and he'd had a bad day and he needed to not be sober for a few hours. The napkin was just what was available when the idea hit.

> "The Sandy Hut doesn't have good lighting. The napkin was a bar napkin, not even a cocktail napkin—the thin brown kind that falls apart if you look at it wrong. I sketched the diagram with a pen I borrowed from the bartender. She didn't ask what I was drawing. That's the kind of place it is."
> — Alan's notes

**Details:**
- Cash only (or was, for decades)
- No food except bags of chips
- Regulars who've been coming for thirty years
- A stuffed deer head named Sandy

## Northside Behavioral Health

### Meri's Clinic
**Address:** N Lombard Street, St. Johns neighborhood

Meri's clinic is in St. Johns—a neighborhood that feels like its own small town, separated from the rest of Portland by industrial zones and the curve of the Willamette. It's where Portland's working class lives, where the rent is still (barely) affordable, where her patients can actually get to her.

The clinic is in a converted house on Lombard, the main drag. Two-story, painted gray, a sign out front that says "Northside Behavioral Health" in letters designed not to draw attention. Most of her patients don't want the neighbors knowing where they're going.

> "St. Johns is twenty minutes from downtown but it feels like a different city. My patients are line cooks and bus drivers and Amazon warehouse workers. They're not the people who can afford boutique mental health care in the Pearl. Thursday is my anchor. It reminds me that most people aren't debating AI consciousness—they're trying to get through the week."
> — Meri

**Thursday routine:**
- 7:30 AM: Coffee at Cathedral Coffee (N Lombard)
- 8:00 AM - 6:00 PM: Patients (30-minute TMS sessions, 60-minute intakes)
- Sometimes: Walk to Cathedral Park after, watch the bridge

## Declan's School

### Cleveland High School
**Address:** 3400 SE 26th Avenue (Southeast Portland)

Declan teaches at Cleveland—a big public high school in inner Southeast, the kind of school that's changed dramatically as the neighborhood gentrified around it. Half the students are from families who've been there for generations; half are from families who moved into the new condos.

Cleveland has a strong humanities program. Declan's AP Government class is known for being rigorous and for going off-syllabus into philosophy and constitutional theory. He's been teaching there for 23 years. Three principals have come and gone. He remains.

> "Cleveland isn't a magnet school. It's not where the ambitious parents send their kids. It's where the neighborhood kids go. That's what I wanted. I teach the students who didn't choose me—and some of them become interested anyway. That's more honest than teaching kids who already care."
> — Declan

**Details:**
- His classroom (Room 204) has a "Question Everything" poster that he's had since 1998
- He coaches the debate team, reluctantly
- The school's mascot is a Warrior (he finds this uncomfortable but hasn't successfully lobbied to change it)

## Whit's Courthouse

### Multnomah County Courthouse
**Address:** 1021 SW 4th Avenue (Downtown Portland)

Whit works out of the Multnomah County Courthouse—a 1914 building with marble floors, brass fixtures, and courtrooms that smell like old paper and anxiety. The public defender's office is in the basement, naturally. Limited windows. Fluorescent lights. A perpetual sense of being overwhelmed.

He handles cases in the Multnomah County Circuit Court—arraignments, bail hearings, trials for people who can't afford representation. Most of his clients are poor. Many are mentally ill or addicted or both. The system is designed to process them as efficiently as possible. Whit is sand in the gears.

> "The courthouse is beautiful if you don't think about what happens inside it. Marble and brass and carved wood—built when people believed in the dignity of the law. Now it processes three hundred cases a day. My job is to slow it down. To make them look at my client as a person, not a docket number. I lose more than I win. But I slow them down."
> — Whit

**Also:**
- Mark O. Hatfield Federal Courthouse (across the street) — where federal cases go, where government liaisons might meet
- Justice Center (adjacent) — county jail, where Whit visits clients

## The Game Table

### DM's House: Alameda Ridge
**Address:** A Craftsman on NE Regents Drive

The D&D game happens at DM's house—a 1920s Craftsman in Alameda, one of Portland's old-money neighborhoods. She bought it twelve years ago, before the market went insane, with money from a database company acquisition. It's the nicest house any of them own.

The game room is in the basement—finished, carpeted, with a custom table DM had built. Bookshelves line the walls: fantasy novels, history, game sourcebooks. A mini-fridge keeps drinks cold. The table has built-in dice trays and tablet mounts for character sheets.

They've been playing here for nine years. The basement has seen character deaths, arguments about rules, late-night conversations that had nothing to do with the game. It's the safest space any of them have.

> "DM's basement is the one place where rank doesn't matter. At work, she's CEO. At the table, she's just the DM—and we argue with her about saving throws like equals. I think she needs that. I think we all do."
> — Alan

**Session Details:**
- Every other Saturday, 6 PM to midnight (or later)
- DM provides pizza; players rotate bringing drinks
- Phones go in a basket by the door (honor system, frequently violated)
- DM's recording setup: a Zoom H6 on a small tripod, center of table

## Coffee & Meeting Spots

### Stumptown (Ace Hotel)
**Address:** 1022 SW Stark Street (Downtown)

Where DM takes meetings with people she's trying to impress. Clean lines, good light, the coffee's actually good. Looks serious without being corporate.

### Heart Coffee (Woodstock)
**Address:** 5105 SE Woodstock Blvd

Where Meri goes when she needs to think. Far enough from downtown that she won't run into Marble Porch people. Quiet neighborhood vibe.

### Coava (SE Hawthorne)
**Address:** 2631 SE Hawthorne Blvd

Where TenX used to work before they had an office. Still goes there sometimes, out of habit. The baristas know their order.

### The Press Club
**Address:** 2621 SE Clinton Street

A bar with good whiskey and dim lighting. Where Alan and Whit meet when Whit wants to argue about something. Not a dive, not fancy. Just a bar.

## Other Significant Locations

### Powell's City of Books
**Address:** 1005 W Burnside Street

The world's largest independent bookstore. A full city block. Color-coded rooms. Where the philosophy consultants browse (Gold Room, philosophy section) before they disappear. Where Alan buys books about Stoicism that he doesn't finish.

### Cathedral Park
**Address:** N Edison Street & Pittsburgh Avenue (St. Johns)

Under the St. Johns Bridge, along the Willamette. Gothic arches holding up the bridge, a park underneath. Where Meri walks after Thursday sessions sometimes. Where she thinks about what she's building and whether it's the rot.

> "The bridge looks like a cathedral. That's why they call it that. I sit on the benches and watch the water and think about my mother's church and my clinic and Marble Porch. Are they really that different? People looking for something to fix them. Maybe I'm the cathedral. Maybe I'm the rot. The river doesn't care."
> — Meri

### OHSU (Oregon Health & Science University)
**Address:** 3181 SW Sam Jackson Park Road (on the hill)

Portland's major research hospital, up on Marquam Hill with the tram. Where the TMS research happens. Where Meri got her own treatment. Where Marble Porch has medical advisors they rarely contact.

### Guardian Games
**Address:** 345 SE Taylor Street (near Marble Porch's first office)

Portland's biggest game store. Multiple floors, huge game space. Where DM buys new sourcebooks. Where TenX wandered sometimes, when they needed to not be at the office. Not where the group plays—they're too established for public tables—but connected to the ecosystem.

## The Angel's Territory

The Angel is not from Portland.

Meetings happen when he comes to town—at the Dossier Hotel downtown (boutique, private meeting rooms), or at restaurants picked for discretion rather than food. He has opinions about Portland (too weird, too wet, too far from the real tech money) but he invested anyway because he saw what virtueOS could become.

When things get serious, meetings move to San Francisco—his turf. The board meeting where they vote on the government pivot (Chapter 13) happens at a law firm on Market Street.

---

## Government Locations

### Federal Presence

**Mark O. Hatfield Federal Courthouse:** Where formal meetings with government liaisons happen. Named for Oregon's moderate Republican senator. The irony is not lost on Val.

**FBI Portland Field Office:** 9109 NE Cascades Parkway (out in the suburbs, near the airport). Where the less formal conversations happen. Val has been there twice.

**Unnamed Facility:** The government's serious work doesn't happen in Portland. When Operation Philosopher King is discussed, people fly to DC or to locations that aren't named in documents.

---

## Weather & Atmosphere

Portland's weather is a character:

- **October-March:** Gray. Drizzle. The kind of rain that doesn't fall so much as just exists in the air. Depression rates spike. SAD lamps sell out. This is when the story's main action happens.

- **July-August:** Bright, dry, almost aggressively pleasant. Everyone goes outside. Meetings move to patios. This is when the napkin gets drawn—a warm October evening, unusual, the last gasp of summer.

- **Smoke Season (August-September):** Wildfires in the gorge and the coast range fill the city with haze. Unhealthy air days. A reminder that nature is not tame. (Could be used thematically if the timeline works.)

---

## Transit Notes

- Most characters drive, but parking downtown is a nightmare
- MAX Light Rail connects downtown to the eastside neighborhoods
- The streetcar runs through the Pearl (Marble Porch's later office)
- The St. Johns Bridge is the most beautiful way to get to Meri's clinic
- Whit bikes to the courthouse when weather permits (and sometimes when it doesn't)

## Open Questions

1. Where does Alan live? (Probably inner SE—Division or Hawthorne area. Walkable to bars.)

2. Where does Val live? (Probably somewhere secure and suburban. Lake Oswego? West Linn? Somewhere with good sight lines.)

3. Where does TenX live? (Probably somewhere small and functional. A studio apartment they barely use because they're always at the office.)

4. Do any scenes happen in specific Portland locations beyond offices and homes? (Powell's? The Japanese Garden? The gorge?)

5. The government demonstration (Scenario Falcon)—does that happen in Portland or somewhere else?
