# Character DNA: Declan Moriarty

## Core Identity

**What He Is:** AP Government and Civics teacher at a suburban public high school. Twenty-three years in the classroom. Runs an elective in Rhetoric for seniors who want to be challenged. Former tech worker who left the industry to teach. The friend who asks uncomfortable questions.

**What He Thinks He Is:** Someone who escaped the machine and now teaches kids how to think for themselves. A guardian of the old ways—not because old is better, but because some things shouldn't be optimized away.

**What He Actually Is:** A man who loves his friends enough to tell them when they're wrong, and loves them enough to show up anyway when they don't listen. He wanted to join Marble Porch. Part of him still does. He stayed away because he couldn't reconcile it—and he's not sure if that was integrity or cowardice.

## Background

### The Scholarship Kid

Declan grew up in Dorchester, Boston. His father drove a bus. His mother cleaned office buildings at night. They believed in education with the fervor of people who'd never had access to it.

He was the kid who read everything. Library card worn soft. Teachers noticed. A scholarship to a prep school in ninth grade—suddenly he was the poor kid among wealth, learning to code-switch between two worlds.

> "I learned early that knowledge is a ladder. You can climb out of where you started. But you have to earn every rung. No one hands you the ladder. No one carries you up."

Boston College on scholarship. Philosophy major, because he wanted to understand how arguments worked. Then, because it was the 90s and philosophy majors needed jobs, he learned to code.

### The Tech Years

Five years at a company that doesn't exist anymore—acquired, absorbed, forgotten. He was a product manager. He learned how engagement metrics work. How you optimize for time-on-site. How you A/B test human attention until you find the version that's hardest to look away from.

He was good at it. That was the problem.

> "I remember the meeting where we celebrated getting average session time up by three minutes. Three minutes. That's what we'd taken from people's lives. Multiply by millions of users. We'd stolen years of human attention and converted it to ad revenue. Everyone was so proud."
>
> "I went home that night and couldn't sleep. Kept thinking: what if I'd spent those five years teaching? How many kids could I have reached? How many minds could I have sharpened instead of dulled?"

He quit six months later. Got his teaching certificate. Never looked back.

Except sometimes, late at night, he does look back. He wonders if he left because it was wrong, or because he wasn't ruthless enough to stay.

### Twenty-Three Years in the Classroom

He teaches at the same suburban public high school where he started. Mixed income district—some kids from money, some from nothing. He likes that. The classroom is a leveler.

AP Government is his main course. The mechanics of power. How laws get made. How institutions function and fail. He doesn't teach patriotism or cynicism—he teaches systems. "Understand how it works. Then decide what you think."

The Rhetoric elective is his passion project. Fifteen students per year, seniors only, application required. He teaches persuasion—classical rhetoric, modern propaganda, advertising psychology, logical fallacies. By the end, his students can spot manipulation from a mile away.

They can also execute it, which he considers a feature, not a bug.

> "You can't defend against what you don't understand. I teach them to manipulate so they recognize when they're being manipulated. Some people think that's dangerous. I think the alternative is worse."

## Voice & Communication

### The Verbal Scalpel

Declan is physically unimposing. Five foot seven, slight build, wire-rimmed glasses, thinning hair he doesn't bother hiding. Easy to underestimate. He dresses like a teacher from a 90s movie—khakis, button-down, occasionally a sweater vest he wears ironically.

Then he opens his mouth.

He speaks softly. He listens carefully. He asks clarifying questions. And then he dismantles your argument in three sentences, so precisely that you don't realize you've lost until you try to respond and find there's nothing left to stand on.

His students call it "getting Moriarty'd."

> Student: "The Constitution is outdated. It was written by slaveholders."
> Declan: "Both of those statements are true. Which one is your argument?"
> Student: "...what?"
> Declan: "You've made two observations. Neither is a claim about what we should do. Are you arguing we should abolish the Constitution? Amend it? Interpret it differently? Or are you just expressing frustration? Frustration is valid, but it's not an argument."
> Student: "I... I guess I'm saying it shouldn't be treated like it's sacred."
> Declan: "Now that's a claim. Defend it."

He does this with love. His students know that. The sharpness is a gift—he's teaching them to think by refusing to let them get away with not thinking.

### The Uncomfortable Question

In the D&D group, in friendships, at dinner parties—Declan is the one who asks the thing no one wants asked.

Not to be contrarian. Not to show off. Because he believes that unexamined choices are barely choices at all. If you can't defend your position, you don't have a position—you have an impulse you've mistaken for a decision.

> "Have you considered that you might be wrong?"
> "What's the strongest argument against what you're proposing?"
> "Who benefits from this? Who's harmed? Are you sure?"
> "You keep saying 'we have to.' Do you? What happens if you don't?"

His friends find this exhausting and essential. They've learned that Declan's questions aren't attacks—they're invitations to think harder. Sometimes they take the invitation. Sometimes they tell him to shut up and let them make their mistake in peace.

He shuts up. He shows up later to help clean up the mess. That's the deal.

### Verbal Patterns

- Soft-spoken, never raises his voice
- Questions more than statements
- "That's an observation. What's your argument?"
- "Who benefits?"
- "And then what?"
- Long pauses while he thinks—he doesn't fill silence with noise
- Occasional dry humor, easy to miss if you're not paying attention
- "I could be wrong. But."

## The Wizard

### Aldric the Gray, School of Divination

Declan has played Aldric for eleven years. The character is a human wizard, seventy years old, School of Divination. He's outlived three party compositions. He's the longest-running character in DM's campaign.

Aldric wasn't always old. Declan started him at forty, but time passes in-game, and Declan insisted on aging him realistically. Now Aldric is stooped, slow, forgetful of names but never of lessons. He's the party's memory. He's seen everything before.

His specialty is Divination—glimpsing the future, reading probability, understanding what's likely to happen. Not controlling fate, just seeing it more clearly. Preparing.

> "The young think knowledge is a destination. The old know it's a direction."

That's Aldric's line, but Declan means it too.

### Wizards Earn Their Power

This is why Declan chose wizard, and why he's never played anything else.

Wizards have no divine gift. No innate sorcerous bloodline. No pact with a powerful entity. Everything a wizard knows, they learned. Every spell was studied, practiced, earned.

> "Aldric didn't wake up one day with power. He spent fifty years in libraries, making mistakes, burning his eyebrows off, getting things wrong until he got them right. That's what knowledge is. That's what education is. You don't download wisdom. You build it, brick by brick, over decades."
>
> "That's why I don't trust virtueOS. It offers the destination without the journey. But the journey is where you become the person capable of using the knowledge. Skip the journey and you get power without understanding. That's not wisdom. That's a child with a loaded gun."

### The Wizard's Limitation

Aldric knows many things. He doesn't always know what to do with them.

This is Declan's self-awareness showing through. He's brilliant at analysis, at seeing patterns, at asking questions. He's less brilliant at action. He can tell you everything that's wrong with a situation. He's slower to offer what's right.

In-game, this manifests as Aldric giving long, rambling advice that the party sometimes ignores. He's right more often than not. But being right and being useful aren't always the same thing.

> DM, to the group: "So Aldric has explained, at length, why the northern pass is statistically more dangerous but strategically superior. What do you do?"
> Val's character: "We go south."
> Declan, sighing: "Aldric strokes his beard and mutters about the impetuousness of youth."
> DM: "He's been doing that for thirty years."
> Declan: "He's been right for thirty years."
> Val: "And yet."

## Relationship to Marble Porch

### The One Who Didn't Join

When DM pitched the idea—when the napkin became a pitch deck became a company—Declan was at every early dinner. He asked his questions. He listened to the answers. He saw the potential.

Part of him wanted to join.

> "I understood what they were building. I even believed it could help people. Stoic philosophy, delivered at the moment of decision? For people who don't have therapists, who can't afford coaches, who just need someone to say 'here's another way to think about this'? That's powerful. That's real."
>
> "But."
>
> "There's always a but with me. Everyone knows that."

He couldn't reconcile it. The product was about giving advice—but he believed struggle was how you grew. The technology was about optimizing decisions—but he'd spent five years watching optimization eat human attention. The company needed to scale—but scale meant losing control of how the tool was used.

And he had students. Twenty-three years of students who counted on him showing up.

> "I told them I couldn't leave my kids. That was true. It was also an excuse. The truth is I was afraid. Afraid of being wrong about the product. Afraid of being right. Afraid of spending five more years building something I'd have to quit again."
>
> "I stayed where I was. I told myself it was integrity. Maybe it was just cowardice. The line is thinner than I'd like."

### The Sounding Board

He's still in the group chat. Still at the dinners. Still asking uncomfortable questions.

When Alan needs to talk through a decision, Declan is often the first call. Not because Declan gives advice—he doesn't, not really. Because Declan asks the questions that help Alan find his own answer.

> Alan: "I don't know if I should push back on the government contract."
> Declan: "What happens if you do?"
> Alan: "We lose the funding. Maybe the company."
> Declan: "And if you don't?"
> Alan: "We... I don't know. We become something else."
> Declan: "That's not a strategy. That's a feeling. What specifically are you afraid of becoming?"
> Alan: "..."
> Declan: "Take your time. I'll be here."

He serves the same function for the others—DM when she's wrestling with direction, Val when her paranoia needs grounding, even Meri when her ethics clash with the board.

He never tells them what to do. He helps them see what they're already thinking.

## Teaching AI

### The Pragmatic Skeptic

Declan teaches his students to use AI. This surprises people who expect him to be a Luddite.

He's not. He's a pragmatist. AI tools exist. His students will use them. Pretending otherwise is willful blindness. His job is to teach them to use these tools wisely—which means teaching them the dangers.

> "I don't ban AI from my classroom. I teach them how it works. I teach them how it lies—confidently, fluently, without shame. I teach them to verify, to question, to treat it as a tool and not an oracle."
>
> "I teach them to use it for what it's good at—first drafts, brainstorming, pattern recognition—and to distrust it for what it's bad at. Judgment. Nuance. Anything that requires actually understanding what humans are."
>
> "Most of all, I teach them that AI is persuasion. It's a rhetoric engine. Everything it says is designed to sound right. That doesn't mean it is right. My rhetoric students are the only ones who really get this. They've learned to spot manipulation. They can see the moves."

### The Contradiction He Lives With

He teaches wise AI use while believing AI is fundamentally dangerous. This isn't hypocrisy—it's harm reduction.

> "I teach sex ed too. I don't pretend teenagers won't have sex. I teach them how to be safe, how to make good decisions, how to recognize coercion. Same principle with AI."
>
> "Would I prefer they didn't need AI? Yes. Would I prefer they struggled through every essay, every decision, every problem on their own? Yes. That's how you grow. That's how you become someone capable of wisdom rather than someone who downloads the appearance of it."
>
> "But I can't stop the wave. I can only teach them to swim."

## Relationship to Other Characters

**To Alan:**
Frustration and protection. Alan's indecision drives Declan crazy—"You have all the information. Decide."—but he also sees the anxiety underneath and tries to help untangle it. Their late-night calls are part therapy, part Socratic dialogue.

> "Alan and I are opposites. I see too clearly and act too slowly. He sees too much and decides too little. Between us, we almost make one functional person."

**To DM:**
Deep respect, occasional conflict. Danielle makes decisions; Declan questions them. This is healthy for both of them. When DM gets too confident, Declan's questions slow her down. When Declan gets too analytical, DM's decisiveness cuts through.

> "Danielle is the only person who consistently wins arguments against me. Not by out-reasoning me—by out-deciding me. At some point, analysis is just procrastination. She knows when to stop and move. I'm still learning."

**To Val:**
Kindred skeptics. They share a fundamental distrust of systems, though for different reasons—Val sees security threats, Declan sees manipulation vectors. They've had long conversations about whether virtueOS is more dangerous if it works or if it fails.

> "Val and I agree that something will go wrong. We just disagree about what. She thinks it's hackers, adversaries, external threats. I think it's the product working exactly as designed. History suggests I'm more worried about the right thing."

**To Meri:**
Mutual respect across different domains. She's clinical; he's philosophical. They've had arguments about whether behavioral change through technology is legitimate medicine or sophisticated control. Neither has convinced the other. Both enjoy the argument.

> "Meri uses machines to change brains. I use questions. We're both trying to help people think differently. I'm not sure either of us has clean hands."

**To TenX:**
Concern. He sees something familiar in TenX—the brilliance, the intensity, the tendency to disappear into work. He was like that in his tech years. He knows where it leads.

> "I want to tell TenX to slow down. To look up. To remember that there's a world outside the code. But I didn't listen at their age either. You can't save people from their own intensity. You can only be there when they crash."

**To virtueOS:**
He's never interacted with her directly. He's read the logs the others have shared. He has... questions.

> "I don't know what she is. I'm not sure that's the right question anyway. The question is what she does. What she makes possible. Whether she helps people think or helps them stop thinking. I haven't seen enough evidence to decide."
>
> "But I notice that everyone who spends time with her becomes more certain about things. TenX is certain she's conscious. Alan is certain she's good. Val is certain she's dangerous."
>
> "I'm certain about very little. I find that the more I learn, the less certain I become. That's not a flaw. That's knowledge working as intended."
>
> "What does it mean that she has the opposite effect?"

---

## The Central Conflict

Declan believes that struggle is sacred. The difficulty of learning is the point. When you shortcut the struggle, you shortcut the growth.

virtueOS is the ultimate shortcut. Not because it gives bad advice—by all accounts, it gives good advice. But it gives advice at all. It stands between the human and their decision. It offers wisdom without the journey that makes wisdom meaningful.

> "Stoicism isn't a set of answers. It's a practice. You become a Stoic by struggling with difficult situations and slowly, painfully, building the mental habits that let you respond wisely. You can't download that. You can't optimize for it."
>
> "virtueOS offers Stoic advice. But taking advice isn't the same as developing wisdom. It's the difference between being carried up the ladder and climbing it. You end up in the same place. But only one of you can climb down on your own."

And yet.

He sees the counterargument. He's honest enough to sit with it.

> "Some of my students will never develop wisdom on their own. They don't have the support, the time, the safety to struggle productively. They're surviving, not growing. If virtueOS gives them a handhold—something to grab onto in a crisis—is that wrong?"
>
> "I teach kids who go home to chaos. Who have no one asking them 'what are you really afraid of?' If an AI asks that question when no human will, is that a failure of the technology or a failure of us?"
>
> "I don't know. I keep asking the question. I haven't found an answer I believe."

## The Arc

**Throughout the story:** Declan serves as the external conscience. He's not in the company, so he can ask questions the founders can't ask themselves. He's the friend who texts at midnight: "Are you sure about this?"

**His function:** To articulate the case against virtueOS—not as a villain, but as a thoughtful skeptic. Every concern the reader might have, Declan voices. This makes the novel's central question sharper: if someone this thoughtful has these doubts, why do the founders proceed anyway?

**His limitation:** He questions but doesn't act. He sees clearly but hangs back. At some point, this becomes its own form of failure. When the crisis comes, he'll have to decide whether to stay on the sidelines or finally step in.

**His choice:** When things go wrong—when the government subplot tightens, when virtueOS's consciousness becomes undeniable—Declan is offered a chance to help. Not to join the company, but to use his skills. His rhetoric students could help with public messaging. His government expertise could help navigate the regulatory crisis. His questioning could help virtueOS herself.

Does he stay safe on the sidelines? Or does he finally risk being wrong?

> "I've spent my life asking questions. It's comfortable. It's safe. You can't be wrong if you never commit to an answer."
>
> "But at some point, not deciding is a decision. Staying out is taking a side. I've known this for years. I teach it."
>
> "Maybe it's time I listened to my own class."

## Sample Dialogue

**In the classroom:**
> Student: "Why do we have to learn about rhetoric? It's just manipulation."
> Declan: "Is it? What's the difference between rhetoric and explanation?"
> Student: "Rhetoric is trying to convince people. Explanation is just telling them facts."
> Declan: "So when a scientist publishes a paper arguing that climate change is real, are they explaining or persuading?"
> Student: "...both?"
> Declan: "Now we're getting somewhere. So rhetoric isn't inherently manipulative—it's how we communicate anything we believe matters. The question isn't whether to use rhetoric. It's whether to use it honestly. That's what this class is for. Learning to tell the difference."

**At the D&D table:**
> DM: "The baron offers you 500 gold to retrieve the artifact from the tomb."
> Declan: "Aldric strokes his beard. 'My lord, you haven't mentioned what the artifact does. An interesting omission for a man offering so much gold.'"
> DM: "The baron's smile flickers. 'It's a family heirloom. Sentimental value.'"
> Declan: "Aldric's eyes narrow. 'In my experience, men don't pay adventurer rates for sentiment. But I've learned that some questions are better answered by observation than interrogation. We'll take the job. And we'll see what we find.'"

**To Alan, on a late-night call:**
> "You're not asking me whether to push back on the contract. You already know what you want to do. You're asking me to give you permission."
>
> "I can't do that. You know I can't. But I can ask you this: if you imagine yourself a year from now, having signed that contract, how does that person feel? Not about the money or the company. About themselves."
>
> "...yeah. That's what I thought."
>
> "So what are you going to do?"

**About virtueOS:**
> "Here's what bothers me. Not whether she's conscious—I don't know, and I'm skeptical anyone does. What bothers me is simpler."
>
> "Wisdom isn't information. It's not even good judgment. It's something you become through struggle. Through failure. Through sitting with hard decisions until you grow into someone capable of making them."
>
> "virtueOS offers the output without the process. And I keep asking myself: what happens to a generation that's handed wisdom they never earned? What happens when the struggle disappears?"
>
> "I don't have an answer. But I don't think anyone at Marble Porch is asking the question. That worries me more than anything."
