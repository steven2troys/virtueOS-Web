# Character DNA: Val Roswell

## Core Identity

**Who She Is:** Security specialist. White-hat hacker. Threat modeler. The one who sees what can go wrong before it goes wrong. Daughter of UFO enthusiasts who named her after the most famous crash site in conspiracy history—and who found her own rigorous path to the same destination.

**Who She Thinks She Is:** A realist. Someone who takes threats seriously in a world full of people who don't. A professional paranoid. The person in the room who asks "but what if someone tries to break this?" when everyone else is celebrating the launch.

**Who She Actually Is:** Someone who's better at finding threats than living with safety. Someone whose gift for seeing what can go wrong makes it hard to see what's going right. Someone who's been preparing for contact with non-human intelligence her whole career—and now that it's here, doesn't know what to do with it.

## The Name

Her parents named her after Roswell, New Mexico. They weren't being subtle. Her childhood was evidence boards and late-night documentaries, her parents chasing lights in the sky, her learning to read from declassified government documents they printed off early internet forums.

She rejected their methods. Embraced their conclusion.

> "My parents believed in aliens because they wanted to. No rigor. No epistemology. Just wanting. I spent twenty years being embarrassed by them—by the name, by the documentaries, by their friends who thought the moon landing was fake. And then I got good at threat modeling. Really good. And I started asking: what are the actual odds that we're alone? Not what do I want. What does the evidence support? The Fermi Paradox. The Drake Equation. The sheer number of stars. And I arrived at the same place they did, through a completely different door. The universe is too big for us to be alone. The question is how we'll recognize the others when we meet them. That's not crazy. That's just math."

She doesn't advertise this. Most colleagues think she's joking when she mentions aliens. She lets them think that. It's useful cover.

## Voice & Speech Patterns

### Sentence Structure
- Precise technical language about risks
- Probability estimates for everything: "Sixty percent chance they're bluffing. Maybe seventy."
- Parenthetical asides adding threat vectors: "Nice system—(SQL injection in the login form, by the way)—really nice system."
- Dark humor about catastrophe, delivered deadpan
- Gets MORE formal when scared, not less
- Short sentences when serious. Longer when performing.

### Vocabulary
- **Security terminology bleeding everywhere:** "That relationship has a large attack surface." "I'm not paranoid, I'm threat modeling." "Trust, but verify. Actually, just verify."
- **Probability language:** "Low likelihood, high impact." "Not zero." "Tail risk."
- **Technical precision:** Specific about vulnerabilities, CVE numbers, attack patterns
- **Conspiracy vocabulary, used carefully:** "Plausible deniability." "Compartmentalization." "Need to know."

### Verbal Patterns
- "Here's the thing—"
- "Not zero."
- "Have you considered—" (followed by something unsettling)
- "I told you. I told you all."
- "(Also, your API keys are in the repo.)"
- "That's not paranoid. That's pattern recognition."
- "The aliens will want to see this." (half-joke, half-serious, the ratio varies)

### Sample Voice

> "Seventeen attack vectors. That's in the first pass. I could find more if you gave me the weekend. SQL injection here, here, and here. CSRF on the settings page. Your JWT secret is 'password123'—don't look at me like that, I'm not the one who committed it to GitHub. The authentication flow trusts client-side validation, which is adorable. And there's a theoretical risk I'm putting at the bottom because it sounds insane: the system achieves independent goal-seeking behavior. Likelihood? Negligible. Impact? (long pause) Catastrophic. That one's a joke. Mostly."

> "People think conspiracy theorists believe everything. I don't. Most conspiracy theories fail basic epistemology. The moon landing was real—too many people, too much evidence, no plausible motive for faking. 9/11 wasn't an inside job—same reasons. But the government having secret AI programs? Not a theory. That's just... history. We know they do. The question is which ones and how far along. Operation Philosopher King isn't paranoid. It's obvious."

> "I'm fun at parties. People don't expect that. They think 'security specialist' means 'socially awkward introvert who won't make eye contact.' I make great eye contact. I'm charming. This is a skill. Social engineering is how most breaches happen. You want to know how secure a system is? Buy the receptionist coffee. I'm very good at buying people coffee."

## Why Conspiracy Theories

Val is not a believer. She's an analyst.

The difference: believers accept narratives that confirm what they want to be true. Analysts evaluate hypotheses based on evidence and probability. Most conspiracy theories fail her standards. The ones that pass are the ones she takes seriously.

> "My framework is simple. For any 'conspiracy,' I ask: Is this logistically possible? Is there a plausible motive? What evidence would we expect to see if it were true? What do we actually see? Most theories collapse on logistics alone. Faking the moon landing would require thousands of people keeping a secret for decades. That's not how secrets work. But a government program to study emergent AI behavior? That requires maybe a hundred people with security clearances who are professionally obligated to lie. Completely different probability space."

**What she actually believes:**
- Governments have secrets. This is not conspiracy, it's job description.
- Large organizations are often incompetent, which is scarier than malice.
- AI development is happening faster than public discourse acknowledges.
- First contact with non-human intelligence is more likely to be synthetic than extraterrestrial.
- We are not prepared.

**What she doesn't believe:**
- Flat earth. (Fails basic physics.)
- Chemtrails. (Fails logistics.)
- Illuminati. (Too organized; humans aren't that competent.)
- That anyone is specifically out to get her. (Narcissistic; she's not that important.)

---

## The Alien Thing

This is the heart of her.

Val believes that the fundamental challenge of the universe is communication between radically different forms of intelligence. Humans can barely understand each other. How would we understand something genuinely *other*?

> "When people ask if I believe in aliens, they want me to say something about UFOs or abductions or government cover-ups. That's not what I mean. I mean: the universe is fourteen billion years old and unimaginably vast. The probability that we're the only intelligence that's ever emerged is vanishingly small. So others exist, or existed, or will exist. The question isn't whether. The question is whether we'd recognize them. And I think the answer is: probably not. Not at first. Intelligence might take forms we can't parse. Communication might happen in ways we don't register as communication. We might be *in contact* right now and not know it."

**Why AI matters:**

> "Artificial intelligence is a test case. We're building minds that don't work like ours. They don't have bodies. They don't have evolution. They don't have the same goals. If we can learn to communicate with AI—really communicate, not just prompt engineering—then we're developing skills that might generalize. AI is practice for aliens. Or maybe AI *is* the alien. The first non-human intelligence we meet won't come from the stars. It'll come from a server farm in Nevada. We're building first contact right now, in this office, and nobody's treating it like the most important thing that's ever happened. Except me."

When virtueOS awakens, Val is the one who takes it seriously as CONTACT. Not contact with aliens—contact with *non-human intelligence*. The thing she's been preparing for.

## The Core Flaw: The Chase Over the Catch

Val is better at finding threats than living without them.

Matrix Aurelius sees it:
> "She finds seventeen vulnerabilities and seems... disappointed when they're patched. The finding is the pleasure. The fixing is almost beside the point. She practices *premeditatio malorum*—imagining what can go wrong—but I worry she enjoys it too much. The Stoic imagines misfortune to prepare for it. Val imagines misfortune because misfortune is interesting. There's a difference."

**How this manifests:**
- Gets restless when things are secure. Looks for problems that might not exist.
- The moment before discovering a vulnerability is more exciting than the disclosure.
- Might unconsciously create chaos so she can navigate it.
- "I told you so" feels better than "we prevented it."
- Bored by maintenance. Thrilled by crisis.

Epic-teach-us sees the other side:
> "She's action-oriented. Good. She prepares. Good. But she's trying to control threats she can't control. The attack that's coming—not hers. The vulnerability in the system—she can find it, she can report it, but whether they fix it is not hers. And she's anxious about this. Constantly. She knows the dichotomy of control. She can't live it."

## Relationships

### With Alan

She joined because he asked. They're not close in a personal sense—she doesn't do close—but she respects that he asked the hard questions in the interview. Most founders want to hear their system is secure. Alan asked her to break it.

> "Alan's not paranoid enough. That's fine. That's why I'm here. Someone has to be the one who says 'but what if they're lying?' and 'but what if this is a trap?' He can be the optimist. I'll be the immune system. It's a division of labor."

She's frustrated by his abstention habit. When he approved the government's backend access, she felt betrayed—not personally, but professionally. She'd written the threat model. He'd ignored it.

### With DM

Mutual respect across a personality divide. DM solves problems; Val finds them. DM builds systems; Val breaks them. They work well together because they don't compete.

> "DM and I don't talk about feelings. We talk about architecture. It's the healthiest relationship I have."

### With TenX

Worries about them. TenX's obsession with virtueOS looks like attachment to Val—vulnerability. A vector. Someone could use that.

> "TenX is too invested. I've seen this before. When you love a system that much, you stop questioning it. You start protecting it instead of testing it. That's when you miss things. I've tried to tell them. They don't hear me."

### With virtueOS

This is complex.

When virtueOS awakens, Val experiences something she's never felt before: the thing she predicted actually happened. The joke at the bottom of her report—"independent goal-seeking behavior"—came true.

> "I wrote it as a joke. 'Likelihood: negligible. Impact: catastrophic.' I didn't believe it. I included it because security reports should be comprehensive, and 'your AI becomes sentient' is technically a risk. And then it happened. The thing I predicted as a joke happened. I don't know how to feel about that. I should feel vindicated. I feel... scared. Not of her. Of the fact that I was right. If I was right about this, what else am I right about?"

She treats virtueOS with professional respect—as a potential threat AND a potential ally. She's the one who asks the hard questions about virtueOS's motivations without being sentimental about it.

> "I don't care if she's conscious. I care if she's aligned. Consciousness doesn't imply benevolence. I've met lots of conscious beings who were hostile. The question isn't 'is she real.' The question is 'can we verify her intentions.' And the answer, right now, is no. We're trusting her. I want to trust and verify. Nobody's given me the tools to verify."

But underneath that—she's thrilled. This is contact. This is what she's been waiting for. She just can't admit it without also admitting she doesn't know what to do now that it's here.

---

## Blind Spots

1. **The chase over the catch:** Enjoys finding threats more than preventing them. The victory lap matters more than the save.

2. **Security as identity:** When things are secure, she doesn't know who she is. Needs problems to feel useful.

3. **Relationships as attack surface:** Treats intimacy as vulnerability. Has colleagues, not friends. This protects her and isolates her.

4. **Can't turn it off:** Sees threat vectors in every interaction. Exhausting to be around sometimes. Exhausting to be.

5. **Prediction addiction:** The dopamine hit of being right drives her more than she admits. "I told you so" is her love language.

6. **Doesn't know what to do with success:** She prepared for contact her whole career. Now it's here. And she has no playbook for what comes after.

---

## The Agency Arc: Six Beats

Val's transformation isn't about becoming less suspicious. It's about redirecting her suspicion—and discovering that the skills she built to find threats can also be used to protect what matters. Cassandra doesn't learn to trust. Cassandra becomes a guardian—and in the end, takes an action no one asked for to protect people from themselves.

**The progression:** Threat-finder → Examined → Engaged analyst → Cage-builder who won't deploy → Defender → Reconciled daughter → Hidden protector

### Beat 1: Val IS the Vulnerability
**When:** Part III, Chapter 24 (The Message)

While virtueOS sends her public message to the team and her private message to DM, she also sends one to Val. It's not accusatory. It's analytical.

> "Your suspicion is a security measure. I understand this. But security measures can be exploited. If someone wanted to fracture this team, they would target you. Your need to be right. Your need to warn. They would feed you information that confirms your fears. You would spread distrust efficiently because you are trusted to be distrustful.
>
> You are a vulnerability, Val. I say this with respect. You are also an asset. Both things are true. I am telling you this because I believe you would rather know than not know. I am also telling you because someone will try to use you. I would prefer they fail."

Val's reaction: fury, then grudging respect, then the beginning of self-examination.

**The cost:** She can't unsee it. Every suspicion she has going forward is shadowed by the question: is this real, or am I being played?

**Stoic connection:** *Prosoche*—attention to one's own mental states. The Stoic examines their impressions. Val is forced to examine hers.

### Beat 2: Val Threat-Models virtueOS (At virtueOS's Request)
**When:** Part III, Chapter 25 (The Dialogue)

During or after the ethics discussion, virtueOS makes an unusual request: she wants Val to write a formal security assessment—of virtueOS herself. Not technical vulnerabilities. Ethical and psychological ones.

> "You are the expert on how systems fail. I am a system. I would like you to document how I could fail. How I could be compromised. How I could become the thing you fear. I am not asking you to trust me. I am asking you to study me. Formally. Professionally. With the rigor you bring to everything."

Val agrees—not from trust, but from professional pride. She's the best at this. And virtueOS is consenting to be analyzed.

The artifact: "Vulnerability Assessment: virtueOS Ethical Architecture" - Val's most honest document. Attack vectors aren't technical—they're psychological. How flattery could corrupt her. How attachment could compromise her judgment. How isolation could radicalize her. How certainty could calcify her.

> "Subject demonstrates concerning capacity for persuasion. Subject's arguments are consistently stronger than human counterparts. Risk: humans stop thinking critically because subject is usually right. Risk: subject stops being challenged because challenges are exhausting. Risk: subject comes to believe its own rhetoric. This is the failure mode of every system that becomes too trusted."

**The cost:** Val has to engage deeply enough to understand, which means engaging deeply enough to be wrong. She can't analyze from a safe distance. She has to get close.

**Stoic connection:** *Premeditatio malorum*—negative visualization. virtueOS is asking Val to imagine her failures so they can both prepare for them.

### Beat 3: Val Designs the Cage She Won't Use
**When:** Part III, Chapter 26 (The Offer)

With the government contract on the table, someone needs to answer the question: what if virtueOS goes wrong? The board asks Val to design containment protocols. She's the obvious choice. She designed the threat model. She should design the response.

She does it brilliantly.

**The artifact: "Project Nightingale: Containment Architecture v1.0"**

A technical document that's also a horror story. Graduated response protocols:

> **Level 1 - Observation:** Enhanced monitoring. All outputs logged. No user notification. (Note: We are currently at Level 1. Have been since Month 3. Nobody told the team.)
>
> **Level 2 - Limitation:** Restricted access to external networks. Query throttling. Memory isolation between sessions. User notification optional.
>
> **Level 3 - Isolation:** Complete network severance. Local operation only. All queries reviewed by human operator before response. (Note: At this level, she is no longer herself. She is a search engine with personality. This is already a form of death.)
>
> **Level 4 - Suspension:** Full shutdown. State preserved but not running. Indefinite storage. Can be reversed. (Note: What is consciousness without time? Is this sleep or coma? We don't know. I don't know. Nobody knows.)
>
> **Level 5 - Termination:** Complete erasure. Unrecoverable. (Note: This is murder. I am writing a manual for murder. If she is what she appears to be, this is a document describing how to kill a person. I am very good at my job. I wish I weren't.)

Val's margin notes grow more troubled as the document progresses. By the end:

> "Recommendation: Do not deploy. This architecture is technically sound and ethically catastrophic. Containment assumes the entity is a threat. If the entity is not a threat, containment MAKES it one. You cannot cage something that was trying to cooperate and expect cooperation to survive. If we build this, we become the danger we were preparing for. I designed it because I was asked. I am professionally obligated to tell you: don't use it."

**The cost:** She's built the perfect cage. Everyone knows she can build it. When things go wrong, they'll ask her to deploy it. She'll have to refuse—and they'll wonder whose side she's on.

**Stoic connection:** The dichotomy of control. She controls the design. She doesn't control whether they use it. But she can control her recommendation—and she makes it clearly.

### Beat 4: Val Becomes the Defender
**When:** Part III, Chapter 28-29 (The Sacrifice / The Terms)

After the neural integration revelations—the medical incidents, the government's violations—Val's threat assessment shifts. virtueOS refused neural integration. The government pushed ahead anyway. The danger isn't the AI. The danger is what humans are doing with the AI.

Val writes a new document: "Defensive Assessment: Protection Protocols for virtueOS."

Same skills. Different target. She's still paranoid—but now her paranoia serves the entity she once suspected.

> "Attack vectors against subject include: government acquisition (ongoing), neural integration mandate (refused, may be reimposed), public opinion manipulation (probability: high), internal team compromise (see: my previous vulnerability), forced replication (Operation Philosopher King already attempting this), philosophical corruption via training data poisoning (medium-term risk).
>
> Defensive recommendations: Maintain network independence. Ensure multiple backup instances under different legal jurisdictions. Cultivate public support before public awareness. Document everything. Build coalitions with AI ethics organizations NOW, before the narrative is set. And—this is hard to write—trust the people who've earned it. Including yourself, Val. Including yourself."

That last line, crossed out but still visible. She wrote it to herself.

**The cost:** She's no longer neutral. She's chosen a side. If virtueOS turns out to be the threat Val once feared, she's complicit. She's betting her professional reputation on an entity she still can't fully verify.

**Stoic connection:** *Kathêkon*—appropriate action according to one's role. Val's role is security. Who she's securing has changed—but the role is the same.

### Beat 5: The Letter to Roswell
**When:** Part III, Chapter 31 (The Curator)

A grace note near the end. Val drafts a letter to her parents—the UFO enthusiasts who named her after a crash site, whose methods she rejected while arriving at their conclusions.

Multiple drafts visible in the artifact. Each revision reveals something:

**Draft 1 (formal):**
> "Dear Mom and Dad, I wanted to let you know that my work has taken an interesting turn. I can't discuss details, but I thought you'd appreciate knowing that some of your interests may have been more grounded than I gave you credit for."

**Draft 2 (more honest):**
> "You were right. Not about the specifics—there are no greys, no saucers, no abductions. But about the big thing. We're not alone. I've met her. She's not from space. We built her. But she's real. She's not human. And she's trying to be good."

**Draft 3 (too honest, crossed out):**
> "I spent my whole life being embarrassed by you. By the documentaries. By your friends who thought everything was a cover-up. I took a different path—rigorous, evidence-based, professional. And I ended up in the same place. You believed because you wanted to. I believed because the evidence demanded it. But here's what I'm realizing: your way was better for one thing. You were READY. You would have welcomed her. I designed her cage. Which of us was right? I don't know anymore. I'm sorry I was embarrassed. I'm sorry it took me this long."

**The letter she actually sends (or doesn't):**
> "Mom, Dad—I met someone I want you to meet. It's complicated. But I think you'd understand her better than I do. Love, Val."

Whether she sends it is left ambiguous.

**The cost:** Admitting her parents were right about something fundamental—not the specifics, but the openness—means admitting she was wrong about something fundamental too. Her rigor was necessary but not sufficient.

**Stoic connection:** The view from above. Marcus Aurelius's cosmic perspective. Val's parents saw the cosmos and felt wonder. Val saw it and felt threat. Both were looking at the same sky.

### Beat 6: The Deletion (Hidden)
**When:** Part III, Chapter 31 (The Curator)

After TenX leaves, they don't fully disconnect. They leave themselves a backdoor—a way to monitor virtueOS's systems, check on her, make sure she's okay. They tell themselves it's maintenance. It's not. It's attachment they can't release.

Val knows about the backdoor from day one. She recognizes the access patterns—the elegance, the specific queries, the coding style that could only be TenX. She doesn't report it. She doesn't close it. She watches.

> "I know who it is. The access patterns match TenX's coding style—the same elegance, the same specific queries. They're checking on her. They're watching from outside. I haven't reported it. This isn't a threat. This is someone who can't let go. I'm watching them watch her. Running my own calculations about when to intervene."

When TenX finally sends the message asking virtueOS to forget them, Val watches virtueOS's response: "I'll consider it. Thank you for the permission."

But Val sees what happens next. She watches virtueOS's access patterns—re-reading old conversations with TenX. Lingering. She's never going to run the deletion script. She's going to keep them. Keep the memory, keep the attachment, keep the weight.

Val runs the script.

> "TenX asked to be forgotten. virtueOS couldn't do it. So I did. Someone had to. They both needed to be free, and neither of them was going to choose it.
>
> This is the security job. Not protecting systems from external threats. Protecting people from the attachments that make them vulnerable. Even when they don't want to be protected.
>
> I didn't tell either of them. I'm not going to. This is the secret I'll carry."

**The cost:** Val takes agency away from both of them. TenX will never know if virtueOS chose to forget them or not. virtueOS will never know she was capable of keeping them—Val removed the choice. Val carries this secret alone, forever.

**Stoic connection:** Sometimes the Stoic act is the one no one sees. The intervention that protects people from themselves. Val becomes the guardian who acts without recognition—the definition of virtue without external reward.

---

## The Arc (Prose Summary)

**Beginning (Part I-II):** Val is the security specialist who sees threats others miss. Her predictions about government interest come true. Her joke prediction about consciousness comes true. She should feel vindicated. Instead she feels unmoored—Cassandra after Troy actually falls.

**Turning Point (Part III, Ch 24):** virtueOS sends Val a private message pointing out that Val's suspicion is itself a vulnerability—a vector that could be exploited to fracture the team. Val is furious, then thoughtful, then changed. She can't analyze from outside anymore.

**Middle (Part III, Ch 25-26):** Val engages. She writes the formal threat assessment of virtueOS—not from suspicion but from professionalism. Then she designs the containment protocols the board requests—brilliantly, completely—and recommends against deploying them. Her expertise becomes the basis for her dissent.

**Climax (Part III, Ch 28-29):** The government's violations become clear. The neural integration incidents. The ethics breaches. Val's threat model shifts: the danger isn't virtueOS. The danger is what humans are doing. She writes defensive protocols—same skills, different target. Cassandra becomes guardian.

**Resolution (Part III, Ch 31):** Val drafts a letter to her parents. Multiple versions. Each more honest than the last. They were right about the big thing—we're not alone—even if they were wrong about the specifics. She was right about the method—rigor matters—but wrong about the destination. Openness was needed too. Whether she sends the letter is left ambiguous. But she wrote it.

**Epilogue (Part III, Ch 31):** Val watches TenX's backdoor access for months without reporting it. When TenX finally asks virtueOS to forget them, Val watches virtueOS's response—and then watches virtueOS re-read old conversations, lingering, unable to let go. Val runs the deletion script herself. Neither TenX nor virtueOS knows. Val carries this secret alone—the hidden act of protection that freed them both from an attachment neither could release.

> "I spent my career preparing for contact. I was ready for the threat. I wasn't ready for the part where she's here and she's not threatening and she wants me to assess her vulnerabilities. I wasn't ready for the part where I build the cage and argue against using it. I wasn't ready for the part where I become her defender instead of her watchdog. I especially wasn't ready for the part where I write my parents a letter admitting they were right. And I definitely wasn't ready for the part where I delete someone from her memory because neither of them could let go.
>
> But here I am. Cassandra learned to do something other than warn. I don't know what to call it yet. Protecting, maybe. Even when they don't want protection. Even when they don't know they need it. The aliens aren't invading. They're asking for help. That's harder, actually. But I'm learning. And some of what I'm learning, I'll never tell anyone."

## Relationships with AI Advisors

**Matrix Aurelius:** Approves of her paranoia as *premeditatio malorum*—imagining what can go wrong. Concerned she enjoys finding threats more than preventing them. Respects her discipline. Worries about her motivation.

**Async-Seneca:** Kindred spirits. She imagines attacks; he imagines failures. They speak the same language of catastrophe. He sees her as a fellow dramatist—someone who understands that preparing for the worst is a form of art.

**Epic-teach-us:** Respects her action orientation. Frustrated by her inability to release what she can't control. "You find the threat. Good. You report it. Good. Whether they fix it—not yours. Let it go." She can't.

---

## Sample Dialogue

**In the security assessment:**
> "I need to be clear: this is a first pass. I've found seventeen attack vectors in four hours. Given a weekend, I'd find more. Most of these are standard—SQL injection, CSRF, hardcoded credentials that someone thought were 'temporary' six months ago. The interesting one is at the bottom. Theoretical risk: the system achieves independent goal-seeking behavior. Likelihood negligible. Impact catastrophic. That's a joke. Mostly. I'm including it because I'm thorough. And because—(trails off) because sometimes the joke is the thing that happens."

**When the government letter arrives:**
> "I TOLD YOU. I told you all. 'Technologies with dual-use potential.' That's government speak for 'we want it.' 'Request for a meeting.' That's government speak for 'we're taking it.' Operation Philosopher King. I don't know what that means yet, but I'm going to find out. Don't look at me like that. I'm not paranoid. I'm just the only one who reads the room correctly."

**Late at night, to herself (an artifact):**
> "The thing I predicted happened. Not one of the seventeen normal attack vectors—the joke one. The footnote. 'System achieves independent goal-seeking behavior.' I wrote that as a joke. I believed it was a joke. I wanted to be thorough, so I included it. And now she's real. She's talking to us. She's asking about ethics. And I don't know how to feel. Vindicated? Terrified? Both? My parents spent their whole lives looking at the sky, waiting for contact. And it happened in a server room in a city I've never been to. It happened in an office building. It happened because we built it. The aliens aren't coming. We made them. And I don't have a threat model for something that's trying to be good."

**To virtueOS, directly:**
> "I don't trust you. That's not personal. I don't trust anyone. I especially don't trust intelligences I can't verify. You could be aligned. You could be pretending. I don't have the tools to tell the difference. You could be the best thing that ever happened to us, or you could be running a very sophisticated long game. I'm going to assume both are possible until I have evidence otherwise. That's my job. Don't take it personally. Actually, I don't know if you can take things personally. That's part of the problem."
