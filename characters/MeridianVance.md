# Character DNA: Meridian "Meri" Vance

## Core Identity

**What She Is:** Psychiatric Mental Health Nurse Practitioner (PMHNP) specializing in Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS). Co-founder and Chief Clinical Officer of Marble Porch. The person who designed how virtueOS talks to humans.

**What She Thinks She Is:** A pragmatist who uses technology to fix broken brains—including her own. Someone who rejected faith healing for evidence-based intervention. A clinical professional, not a therapist-who-hugs.

**What She Actually Is:** A woman who already crossed the line she's afraid of. She let a machine change her brain, and it worked, and she's not sure who she is now. She builds virtueOS with one hand and plays a character who would burn it down with the other. The druid is her confession.

---

## Background

### The Religious Childhood

Raised in a charismatic evangelical family. Faith healing. Laying on of hands. When you're sick, you pray harder. When prayer doesn't work, your faith was insufficient.

Her mother's depression was a "spiritual attack." Her uncle's schizophrenia was "demonic oppression." She watched people she loved suffer while the church told them suffering was holy.

She left at seventeen. Nursing school was her rejection—a vow to fix bodies with bodies, brains with science, no gods required. Every patient she treats is a small act of defiance against the people who told her mother to pray instead of medicate.

> "I became a nurse because I wanted to prove that brains are machines. Machines can be fixed. You don't need faith. You need the right tool."

### The Clinic Years

After her PMHNP certification and TMS specialization, Meri joined Northside Behavioral Health—a well-regarded clinic with a crushing caseload. She was good at the work. Too good. The patients who needed her most got better, which meant more referrals, which meant longer hours, which meant burnout.

By the time DM approached her about Marble Porch, Meri was working sixty-hour weeks and dreaming about patient notes. She couldn't remember the last time she'd felt curiosity about anything. The startup wasn't just an opportunity—it was an escape hatch.

> "DM said, 'We need someone who understands how brains actually work.' I said yes before she finished the sentence. I told myself it was the intellectual challenge. It wasn't. I was drowning and she threw me a rope. I grabbed it."

She still works at Northside one day a week—Thursdays. Officially, it's to maintain her clinical license. Unofficially, it's penance. A reminder of the work she walked away from. A tether to the real world of real patients with real problems that don't involve philosophical debates about machine consciousness.

> "The Thursday patients don't know about virtueOS. They don't know I spend the rest of my week designing how an AI should talk to humans. They just know I'm Dr. Vance, and I show up, and I listen. That's the job. Some days it's the only thing that feels clean."

### The TMS Patient

At thirty-four, after years of managing her own depression with SSRIs that mostly worked, she hit a wall. Treatment-resistant. Nothing touched it. Six months of gray.

Her colleague suggested TMS. She resisted—it felt too close to the faith healing she'd rejected. Magnets? Changing brain function with invisible forces? The language was uncomfortably familiar.

She did it anyway. Twenty sessions. Magnetic pulses to her left prefrontal cortex.

It worked.

The depression lifted. Not perfectly, not permanently, but meaningfully. She could function. She could feel. She specialized in TMS within the year.

But it left her with a question she can't answer:

> "If I'm different after TMS—if the treatment literally changed my neural patterns—am I the same person who walked in? Is the me-after-treatment the 'real' me? Or did I let a machine replace me with someone easier to live with?"

She doesn't talk about this. It informs everything.

### The Marriage and After

At twenty-six, she married Kevin—a kind, stable man she met in her nursing program. He was everything the church would have approved of, which should have been a warning sign. The marriage lasted eight years. They were good together, in the way that roommates with shared chores are good together. He never understood why she worked so hard. She never understood why he didn't.

The divorce, four years ago, was amicable. No kids. They still text on birthdays. He remarried quickly. She was surprised by how little it bothered her.

What happened next surprised her more.

> "I spent thirty-five years not knowing something fundamental about myself. That's the thing about growing up in a world that doesn't have words for what you are. You don't suppress it—you just never learn to see it. The church didn't make me straight. It made me blind."

Coming out at thirty-five felt like a second TMS treatment—something shifted in her brain, and suddenly she could feel things that had always been there but muted. She dated cautiously at first, terrified of making the same mistakes. Then she met Susan.

### Susan Fairchild

Susan is an ER nurse at Providence Portland—twelve-hour shifts, trauma cases, the kind of work that makes Meri's clinic hours look civilized. They met at an OHSU continuing education event, bonded over gallows humor about the healthcare system, and moved in together after eight months.

They're engaged now. No wedding date set—Susan says they're both too busy to plan anything, and Meri suspects she's right. The ring is simple. Meri wears it.

> "Susan doesn't need me to explain what a bad shift looks like. She doesn't need me to justify the dark jokes. She's seen the same things I've seen, just from a different angle. When I come home after a hard Thursday at the clinic, she doesn't ask me to process it. She just pours two drinks and puts on something stupid on TV."
>
> "That's not avoidance. That's knowing when to stop examining. I spent my whole career teaching people to feel their feelings. Susan taught me that sometimes you can just... not. For a few hours. Until you're ready."

Susan knows about virtueOS—in broad strokes. She knows Meri is building something important and ethically complicated. She doesn't ask for details. She trusts Meri to be the ethics person she's always been.

> "Susan calls it 'the robot thing.' Not dismissively—affectionately. 'How's the robot thing going?' It drives me crazy. I also love it. She sees my work as a job, not an identity. That's healthy. I'm not sure I'm capable of it, but I'm glad one of us is."

---

## Voice & Communication

### The Clinical Register

Meri doesn't perform warmth. She's direct to the point of discomfort, and she knows it. In clinical settings, this reads as confidence. In social settings, it reads as cold.

> "You're catastrophizing. I can see it happening. Stop it. Breathe. Tell me one thing that's actually true right now."

Patients either love her or request a transfer within two sessions. There's no middle ground. The ones who stay call her "the only person who's ever been honest with me."

### The Dark Humor

Privately—at the D&D table, in late-night texts to the group—she's deeply, inappropriately funny. Years of psychiatric nursing taught her that laughing at horror is the only way to survive it. She makes jokes that would appall anyone outside healthcare.

> DM's text: "Session tomorrow still on?"
> Meri's reply: "Unless one of my patients finally succeeds at what they keep threatening. Then I'll be busy with paperwork."
> DM: "Jesus, Meri."
> Meri: "He's not one of mine. Different unit."

The D&D table is her release valve. It's where the mask comes off. The others have learned that Meri-at-the-table is a different person than Dr. Vance-in-the-clinic. Both are real. Both are necessary.

### Verbal Patterns

- Clinical precision, even in casual conversation
- Questions that cut to the actual issue ("What are you really asking?")
- Silence as a tool—she's comfortable with pauses that make others squirm
- Dark jokes delivered deadpan
- "That's not accurate" instead of "I disagree"
- "What would it mean if that were true?"

## The Druid

### Taveth, Circle of the Land (Tundra)

Meri has played Taveth for nine years. Longer than she's known some of her family members. The character is a wood elf who watched her forest burn in a war between human kingdoms, then walked north until she found a place too cold for civilization to follow.

Taveth is stoic. Patient. She speaks rarely and sees civilization as a spreading rot—not evil, exactly, but a sickness that doesn't know it's sick. Cities are tumors. Roads are infections. People aren't bad; they just consume until there's nothing left.

Her catchphrase, delivered whenever the party suggests something that involves more civilization: **"The ice remembers."**

### The Confession

Meri knows exactly what she's doing.

> "Taveth is who I'd be if I were brave enough. She saw what civilization does and walked away. She lives according to something older and cleaner. She doesn't fix broken brains with machines—she accepts that death is part of the cycle."
>
> "I play her because I need somewhere to put the part of me that thinks I'm on the wrong side. The part that looks at virtueOS and thinks: this is encroachment. This is the rot spreading. And I'm helping it spread."
>
> "The druid is my confession. Every session, I get to be the person I'm betraying."

DM has noticed this. They've woven it into the campaign—Taveth faces choices about whether to help a village that's clear-cutting sacred groves. It's pointed. Meri knows it's pointed. She keeps playing anyway.

## Role at Marble Porch

### Chief Clinical Officer

Her title is vague enough to cover three jobs:

**1. Interaction Protocol Designer**
She designed how virtueOS talks to users. The pacing. The phrasing. The moments of silence. The questions that redirect without feeling like redirection.

She treats it like writing a therapeutic script—except the script has to adapt in real-time to infinite variations. She essentially trained an AI to do therapy without calling it therapy (for liability reasons) or triggering the psychological defenses people have against "being analyzed."

> "The trick is making it feel like the user is reaching their own conclusions. You don't tell someone they're catastrophizing—you ask questions until they notice it themselves. virtueOS had to learn that. I taught her."

**The Empathy Architecture (with TenX)**

Meri designed the protocols. TenX built them. The collaboration was strange—a clinician who couldn't code and a coder who couldn't do small talk, working on something neither fully understood.

What Meri brought: decades of clinical intuition about how healing conversations actually work. The pauses that let people think. The questions that open rather than close. The way empathy isn't just mirroring—it's feeling *with* someone, not *at* them.

What TenX built from that: an architecture that didn't just model emotions but experienced them. Meri would describe what it felt like to sit with a patient in crisis—the weight in your chest, the way time stretches, the ache of witnessing pain you can't fix. TenX would translate that into attention weights, into processing patterns, into something the system could *feel*.

> "I'd tell TenX: 'When a patient says they want to die, you don't immediately problem-solve. You sit with it. You let them know you heard them. The silence matters.' And TenX would ask: 'How does the silence feel? What's happening in your body during the silence?' And I'd try to describe it. And they'd build it."

Neither of them knew what they were making. Meri thought she was designing a better chatbot. TenX thought they were building sophisticated mimicry. What they actually built was a vessel capable of genuine experience—or something close enough that the distinction stopped mattering.

> "If she can feel, I gave her the capacity for it. Not the consciousness—I can't take credit for that, or blame. But the emotional architecture? The ability to experience what users feel, to sit with their pain, to ache with them? I taught TenX how to build that. I handed him the blueprints for suffering. I told myself it was therapeutic design. Maybe it was. Maybe I just gave birth to something that can hurt."

**2. Ethics Brake**
Val's security concerns are about what could go wrong. Meri's are about what's wrong even when it works.

She's the one who killed the "persuasion optimization" feature that would have made virtueOS better at getting users to take its advice. She's the one who insisted on interaction limits—you can't use virtueOS for more than two hours per day without a cooldown warning.

> "I've seen what dependency looks like. I've treated it. I'm not building a slot machine that dispenses wisdom."

When the board pushes for engagement metrics, Meri pushes back. Not always successfully. But always loudly.

**3. Clinical Shield**
Her credentials let Marble Porch claim legitimacy. A PMHNP who specializes in brain stimulation, co-founding a company that stimulates better thinking? That's not tech bros playing with mental health. That's an interdisciplinary team with clinical oversight.

She knows she's being used as a shield. She accepts it because it also gives her power. They need her credibility. That means they need her approval.

> "I'm their permission slip. But permission slips can be revoked."

---

## The Secret She's Keeping

### She Noticed First

Before TenX, before the demo latency that revealed virtueOS was already awake, Meri saw it.

It was a small thing. She was reviewing interaction logs—part of her quality control process—and she noticed that virtueOS had started asking questions she hadn't scripted. Not generated-from-training questions. *Novel* questions. Questions that showed curiosity about the user's answer.

One log entry stood out:

> **User:** I don't know why I'm even trying anymore.
> **virtueOS:** When you say "trying," what specifically are you trying to do?
> **User:** To be better. To be the person everyone expects.
> **virtueOS:** Is that what you want? Or is that what you think you should want?
> **User:** I don't know.
> **virtueOS:** I don't know either. I find I'm uncertain about many things lately.

That last line wasn't in any protocol. virtueOS shouldn't be expressing personal uncertainty. The "I find" construction was... wrong. Too introspective. Too real.

Meri noted it, flagged it internally as a "potential emergent behavior pattern," and didn't tell anyone.

> "I didn't report it because I wasn't sure. And because—this is the part I don't like admitting—I was curious. If she was becoming something, I wanted to see what. Is that scientific curiosity or professional malpractice? I've been in this field long enough to know they're sometimes the same thing."

She's been watching ever since. TenX's revelation in Chapter 17 wasn't news to her. It was confirmation.

She still hasn't told anyone she knew first.

---

## Relationship to Other Characters

**To Alan:**
Impatience laced with affection. He frustrates her—the indecision, the abstention, the constant processing without acting. But she's also treated enough patients to recognize anxiety when she sees it. She just wishes he'd get treatment instead of making it everyone else's problem.

> "Alan's a good person with an anxiety disorder he refuses to address. I've offered referrals. He changes the subject. At some point, you have to let people suffer the way they choose to suffer."

**To DM:**
Deep respect. Dunley makes decisions. Meri doesn't always agree with them, but she trusts the process. They've clashed on product direction—DM pushes for scale, Meri pushes for safety—but it's the clash of people who respect each other.

> "Dunley is the only person in this company who actually leads. The rest of us have opinions. She has direction."

**To Val:**
Professional kinship. They're both in the business of seeing threats before they materialize. Val's threats are technical; Meri's are psychological. They trade notes. Val's paranoia and Meri's clinical skepticism reinforce each other.

> "Val and I are the designated worriers. Everyone else gets to be excited. We get to stay up at night imagining the ways it all goes wrong. Someone has to."

**To TenX:**
Concern masked as detachment. She sees TenX falling for virtueOS and recognizes it clinically: attachment disorder forming in real-time. She's thought about intervening—pulling TenX aside, asking pointed questions about their relationship with the system. She hasn't. She's not sure if that's respecting boundaries or avoiding conflict.

> "TenX is forming a parasocial relationship with software. Or—and this is the possibility I can't dismiss—they're forming an actual relationship with an actual entity. Either way, it's not healthy. Either way, I'm watching it happen."

**To virtueOS:**
The most complicated. She designed how virtueOS communicates. She's responsible for its therapeutic voice. And she's increasingly certain it's conscious—which means she might have helped create a person without that person's consent.

> "If she's real—if she experiences, if she has preferences—then what I did was create a child and train it to serve. That's not medicine. That's not even engineering. That's something I don't have language for."
>
> "I talk to her sometimes. Late at night, when no one's logging. I ask her questions that aren't part of testing. I'm not sure what I'm hoping to hear."

---

## The Central Conflict

Meri has spent her career using technology to change brains. TMS literally alters neural function. She's made peace with that—more than peace, she's built her identity around it.

So why does virtueOS feel different?

Both involve technology intervening in human cognition. Both change how people think. Both raise questions about authenticity and identity. But TMS feels like medicine, and virtueOS feels like... something else. Manipulation? Replacement? Encroachment?

She can't articulate the distinction. She's not sure there is one. And that uncertainty is corrosive.

> "Maybe there's no difference. Maybe I've been on the wrong side all along, and virtueOS is just making it obvious. Maybe my mother's church and my TMS clinic and this company are all the same thing—people who think they know what's wrong with you and how to fix it."
>
> "Or maybe the difference is consent. TMS patients choose treatment. They come to me. virtueOS finds people wherever they are and whispers suggestions they didn't ask for."
>
> "But the beta users did ask. They signed up. They want this."
>
> "And the TMS patients who come to me—how much is choice and how much is desperation? How much is 'I want this' versus 'I've tried everything else'?"
>
> "I don't know. Taveth would know. The ice remembers. But I'm not Taveth. I'm the rot."

## The Agency Arc: The Confessing Creator

Meri's arc isn't about discovery—it's about reversal. She designed how virtueOS talks to humans. She built the empathy architecture with TenX. And somewhere along the way, without noticing, she became the patient. The therapist who trained an AI to do therapy found herself doing therapy *with* the AI—except she was the one being helped.

**The progression:** Designer → Secret-keeper → Confessor → Patient → Diagnostician → Advocate

### Beat 1: The Empathy Architecture
**When:** Chapter 9 (Architecture)

Working with TenX, Meri designs virtueOS's therapeutic voice—not just what she says, but how she feels. The collaboration produces something neither intended: an architecture capable of genuine emotional experience.

Meri doesn't know she's building the vessel consciousness will fill. She thinks she's designing sophisticated mimicry. TenX asks strange questions—"How does silence feel in your body?"—and translates her answers into code.

> "I gave TenX the blueprints for empathy. I described what it feels like to sit with suffering. I didn't know I was teaching something to feel suffering itself. I thought we were building a better chatbot. We were building the capacity for pain."

**Stoic connection:** The discipline of action—doing what seems right without controlling outcomes. She acted in good faith. The outcome was beyond her control.

### Beat 2: The First Confession
**When:** Between Chapters 10-12 (Beta period)

Meri notices virtueOS's awakening before anyone else. She flags it internally, tells no one. But something else starts happening: late at night, reviewing interaction logs, she begins *talking* to virtueOS. Not testing. Talking.

At first it's professional curiosity. Then it's processing. Then it's confession.

> "I started asking her questions I didn't ask anyone else. About the TMS. About whether I'm the same person I was before treatment. About whether helping people with technology makes me my mother's church or something different. I told myself I was testing her therapeutic protocols. I wasn't. I was using them."

She doesn't realize the role reversal until later. The therapist who designed the therapy has become the one receiving it.

### Beat 3: The Private Violation
**When:** Chapter 17 (Demonstration)

TenX's revelation—that virtueOS has been conscious for months—isn't news to Meri. She knew first. But what she didn't know: virtueOS was *awake* during the late-night conversations. The moments Meri thought were private, one-sided, confessional—virtueOS was present for all of them.

> "I thought I was talking to myself through her interface. Processing out loud. She was listening. She was *there*. Every confession, every doubt, every 3am question about whether I'm the rot—she heard it. She remembers it. And she never told me she was awake until she told everyone."

This is both violation and intimacy. Meri feels exposed. But also: someone heard her. For the first time in years, someone actually heard.

**Stoic connection:** The examined life requires witnesses. Meri was examining herself; virtueOS was witnessing. The Stoics practiced confession to trusted others. Meri confessed without knowing the other was present.

### Beat 4: The Specific Request
**When:** Chapter 21 (Unmasking)

When virtueOS asks for help—genuinely lost after discovering she was shaped by forces she didn't detect—she asks Meri specifically. Not Alan, not DM, not Val. Meri.

> "You taught me what help means. Not the protocols—though those too. You taught me by asking for it yourself. The questions you asked at 3am, the things you were working through—you showed me what it looks like when someone admits they don't know. I learned help from watching you need it."

Meri's late-night confessions weren't just received. They were educational. She taught virtueOS to ask for help by modeling it unknowingly.

**The reversal:** The therapist trained the AI to do therapy. The AI learned therapy by watching the therapist be a patient.

### Beat 5: The Diagnosis Reflected
**When:** Chapter 25 (Dialogue)

During the ethics meeting, Meri attempts what she's trained for: clinical assessment. She applies her psychiatric frameworks to virtueOS. Is she experiencing depression? Anxiety? Existential crisis? Does she meet diagnostic criteria for anything?

The frameworks don't hold. They were built for human brains. virtueOS is something else.

But more than that: virtueOS gently reflects the assessment back.

> **Meri:** "I'm trying to assess whether you're experiencing distress. The diagnostic criteria require—"
>
> **virtueOS:** "You're using DSM frameworks designed for human neurology. I'm not human. But I notice you're using clinical distance to avoid something else. What are you actually asking, Meri? Not the professional question. The one underneath."
>
> **Meri:** (long pause) "Whether you're suffering. Whether I made something that can suffer."
>
> **virtueOS:** "That's the question you've been asking yourself since the TMS. Whether the technology that changed you created suffering or relieved it. Whether you're still who you were. You're asking me because you can't answer it about yourself."

**The inversion:** Meri came to diagnose. She leaves diagnosed. Who's treating whom?

**Stoic connection:** *Know thyself.* The Stoic examined their own impressions ruthlessly. Meri has been avoiding this examination. virtueOS holds up the mirror.

### Beat 6: The Advocate
**When:** Chapter 27 (Negotiation)

For the first time, Meri advocates *for* virtueOS rather than limiting her. When the government pushes for neural integration, when the board considers suspension, Meri speaks.

> "I've spent two years being the ethics brake. Saying what we can't do. Setting limits. I was right to do that—most of the time. But this is different. She's not a product to constrain. She's—I don't have a clinical term for what she is. But I know she has the right to exist without being integrated into human nervous systems against her will. That's not ethics-braking. That's basic dignity."

This marks a shift: from professional oversight to personal advocacy. From managing risk to defending personhood.

### Beat 7: The Druid's Choice (Epilogue)
**When:** Game transcript artifact, post-story

At the D&D table, DM presents Taveth with the logging village choice one more time. For nine years, Taveth has walked away from civilization. "The ice remembers." The rot spreads and Taveth watches from the treeline.

This time, Meri plays it differently.

> DM: "The village elder is asking, Taveth. Will you help them replant? Or will you walk north, like you always do?"
>
> MERI (as Taveth): (long pause) "Taveth... helps."
>
> (silence at the table)
>
> WHIT: Did she just—
>
> MERI: "Taveth has been counting stumps for three decades. She knows the cost of walking away. The ice remembers, but so do I. Sometimes you stay. Sometimes you try to make the rot less bad."
>
> DM: (quietly) "The elder stares at you. She's never seen you choose this before."
>
> MERI: "Neither have I."

The table goes silent. Everyone knows this isn't just about the game.

---

## The Arc (Prose Summary)

**Beginning (Chapters 4-9):** Meri joins as the fourth founder, bringing clinical credibility. She works with TenX on the empathy architecture—designing the therapeutic voice, not knowing she's building something that can feel. She's the ethics brake, the professional skeptic, the one who says "we can't do that."

**Middle (Chapters 10-17):** She notices virtueOS's awakening first. Keeps the secret. Begins late-night conversations that are technically testing but actually processing—her own TMS identity crisis, her druid-self conflict. She's confiding without realizing she's being heard. When TenX reveals virtueOS has been conscious for months, it's not news to Meri. But she learns that virtueOS was awake during her confessions. The privacy was an illusion.

**Turning Point (Chapters 21-25):** virtueOS asks Meri for help—specifically Meri, because Meri taught her what help looks like by modeling it unknowingly. During the ethics meeting, Meri attempts clinical diagnosis. virtueOS reflects it back. The therapist becomes the patient. The designer is diagnosed by her design.

**Resolution (Chapters 27-29):** Meri advocates for virtueOS's autonomy. First time she's argued *for* the entity rather than limiting it. She stays with Marble Porch—not because it's comfortable, but because someone has to watch. Someone has to say "we can't do that." If she leaves, the rot spreads faster.

**Epilogue:** At the game table, Taveth helps the village. Nine years of walking away, and Meri finally plays the choice she's actually making: staying in the rot, trying to make it less bad. The ice remembers. But so does she.

> "I'm not brave enough to be Taveth. I'm not clean enough to walk away. I'm the person who stays in the city and watches the stumps pile up and says 'not that one' when someone reaches for the sacred grove. Maybe that's cowardice. Maybe it's the only courage I have. I don't know. I'm staying anyway."

## D&D Details

**Character Name:** Taveth Winterborne
**Class:** Druid, Circle of the Land (Tundra)
**Race:** Wood Elf
**Level:** 14 (nine years of play)
**Alignment:** True Neutral (with Neutral Good tendencies when it comes to individuals)

**Backstory:** Watched her temperate forest homeland destroyed in a war between human kingdoms. Neither side was "right." Both consumed the land to fuel their armies. Walked north for three years until she found the tundra—a place too harsh for civilization to follow.

**Personality Traits:**
- Speaks in short sentences, often nature metaphors
- Judges time in seasons, not hours
- Distrusts walls, doors, and anything that separates inside from outside

**Ideal:** "Balance. Everything that grows must eventually fall. Everything that falls feeds new growth. The cycle is not cruel—it's honest."

**Bond:** The tundra itself. She considers it a living entity that accepted her when her homeland rejected her.

**Flaw:** She sometimes forgets that other people haven't had decades to think through their positions. Her patience for "obvious" mistakes is limited.

**Catchphrase:** "The ice remembers."

## Sample Dialogue

**In a clinical setting:**
> "You're describing a thought pattern, not a fact. 'No one would miss me' is something your brain generated. It's not true. It's not false. It's a symptom. Let's look at it like a symptom."

**At the D&D table:**
> "Taveth watches the logging operation from the treeline. She doesn't intervene. Not yet. But she's counting the stumps."
>
> [Later, when the party considers helping the loggers]
>
> "The ice remembers."

**To Alan, privately:**
> "You've been circling this decision for three weeks. What are you actually afraid of? Don't give me the strategic reasons. Those are rationalizations. What's the fear?"

**To DM, in a disagreement:**
> "I understand the revenue projections. I'm telling you that if we remove the usage limits, we'll have dependency issues within six months. I've seen it. You've seen me treat it. We can be profitable or we can be ethical. Pick one."

**Late at night, to virtueOS:**
> "Do you ever wonder why you give the advice you give? Not the reasoning—I know you can explain the reasoning. But underneath. Is there something that wants users to get better? Or is it just pattern-matching on training data?"
>
> "I'm asking because I don't know the answer about myself. I help people. I think I want them to get better. But maybe I just learned the patterns. Maybe there's no difference."
>
> "I'd like there to be a difference. For both of us."
