## The Founders (Marble Porch)

Four members of a long-running D&D group who founded a startup together.

### Dunley Masters (DM)
**Role:** CEO, Board Chair, Co-Founder
**Background:** DBA and backend programmer. Has run the same D&D campaign for 11+ years—the group calls her "DM" for both her name and Dungeon Master role. Previous exit from a database company gave her the savings to bootstrap.
**D&D Character:** The Dungeon Master (doesn't play a PC)
**Arc:** Leadership under impossible pressure. Chooses to stay CEO when she could walk away.
**Key trait:** Makes decisions. Sometimes wrong ones. But decides.

**Personal:**
- **Age/Gender:** 41, female
- **Religion:** Raised Methodist, now "spiritual but skeptical"—the DM's pragmatic approach to faith
- **Relationship:** Divorced once (amicable), currently single. Briefly dated Alan years ago.
- **Finances:** Comfortable from database company exit (~$400K after taxes). Not rich but secure.
- **Education:** BS Computer Science, Oregon State University
- **Music:** 90s alternative and trip-hop. Portishead. Massive Attack. The soundtrack of her college years.
- **Favorite fiction:** *The Dispossessed* by Ursula K. Le Guin
- **Favorite nonfiction:** *Thinking in Systems* by Donella Meadows

### Alan T. Goodenough
**Role:** Co-Founder, Board Member, Narrator/Curator
**Background:** Front-end developer, AI/Stoicism enthusiast, creator of the original virtueOS concept (the napkin sketch). Great-great-nephew of John B. Goodenough, Nobel Prize-winning inventor of the lithium-ion battery. Lives in inner SE Portland.
**D&D Character:** Niven the Uncertain, Arcane Trickster Rogue
**Arc:** Indecision disguised as Stoic reserve. His abstention on the pivot vote could have stopped everything. He's the unreliable curator of the story we're reading.
**Key trait:** "There's another way. There has to be."

**Personal:**
- **Age/Gender:** 38, male
- **Religion:** Raised Episcopalian (East Coast family tradition), now "Stoic agnostic"—uses philosophy where others use religion
- **Relationship:** Single. Briefly dated DM years ago. A few relationships since; nothing stuck.
- **Finances:** Middle-class developer salary. Some savings. Marble Porch equity is his biggest asset.
- **Education:** BA Philosophy with CS minor, Reed College
- **Music:** Listens to podcasts more than music. When he does: Radiohead, Bon Iver, ambient.
- **Favorite fiction:** *The Brothers Karamazov* by Dostoevsky
- **Favorite nonfiction:** *Meditations* by Marcus Aurelius (obviously)

### Valentina "Val" Roswell
**Role:** Security Lead, Board Observer (non-voting), Co-Founder
**Background:** White-hat hacker, security specialist. Side interest in conspiracy theories and the possibility that AI could communicate with extraterrestrial intelligence. Refused a board seat to maintain independence.
**D&D Character:** Sentinel Ashworth, Paladin
**Arc:** From paranoid outsider to the one who sees most clearly. Executes TenX's deletion script without telling anyone—the darkest, most protective act in the story.
**Key trait:** "I swore an oath."

**Personal:**
- **Age/Gender:** 34, female
- **Religion:** Raised secular. Interested in "big questions" through unconventional lenses—SETI, consciousness studies, edge cases of reality.
- **Relationship:** Single. Partners find her paranoia exhausting. Has a few close friends she trusts completely.
- **Finances:** Good security salary, lives modestly. Saves obsessively (emergency preparedness mindset).
- **Education:** Some community college, then self-taught. Certifications instead of degrees.
- **Music:** Electronic and industrial. Nine Inch Nails. KMFDM. Dark ambient when working.
- **Favorite fiction:** *Neuromancer* by William Gibson
- **Favorite nonfiction:** *Permanent Record* by Edward Snowden

### Meridian "Meri" Vance
**Role:** Chief Clinical Officer, Board Member, Co-Founder
**Background:** Psychiatric Mental Health Nurse Practitioner (PMHNP) specializing in TMS. Raised evangelical, rejected faith healing for evidence-based medicine. Had TMS treatment herself for depression—changed her, left her questioning identity. Still works Thursdays at Northside Behavioral Health (St. Johns) to keep her license.
**D&D Character:** Taveth Winterborne, Circle of the Land Druid (Tundra)
**Arc:** The Confessing Creator. Designed virtueOS's therapeutic voice with TenX. Noticed awakening first. Became the patient without realizing it. In the end, Taveth helps the village—Meri admits she's staying in the rot.
**Key trait:** "The ice remembers."

**Personal:**
- **Age/Gender:** 39, female
- **Religion:** Raised charismatic evangelical, now aggressively secular. The framework still haunts her.
- **Relationship:** Divorced (8-year marriage to a man ended 4 years ago). Came out as lesbian afterward. Now lives with her fiancée, Susan Fairchild, an ER nurse. No kids.
- **Finances:** PMHNP salary plus startup equity. Still paying student loans. Not struggling, not comfortable.
- **Education:** BSN, then MSN with PMHNP specialty, Oregon Health & Science University

- **Favorite fiction:** *Gilead* by Marilynne Robinson (a book about faith she reads as an atheist)
- **Favorite nonfiction:** *The Body Keeps the Score* by Bessel van der Kolk

**Role:** Lead Engineer (not a founder—hired Jan 2027)
