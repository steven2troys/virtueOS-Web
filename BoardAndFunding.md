# Marble Porch: Board & Funding Structure

## Funding Timeline

### Pre-Seed (October-November 2026)
**Amount:** ~$50K (personal savings, credit cards, friends)
**Source:** The four founders pool resources

DM cashes out some stock options from her database company days. Alan has savings from his previous job. Val contributes. Meri is the most financially stretched—still paying student loans from her PMHNP program—but puts in what she can.

This covers: legal formation, initial cloud computing costs, prototype development, keeping everyone fed while they build.

---

### Seed Round (December 2026)
**Amount:** $2.4M
**Lead:** The Angel
**Participants:** Portland Venture Group (local angel syndicate)

The pitch happens at Dossier Hotel downtown. The Angel asks uncomfortable questions. They take the money anyway.

**Terms:**
- The Angel: $2M for 18% equity + board seat
- Portland Venture Group: $400K for 4% equity + board observer seat (later upgraded to full seat)
- Founders retain: 78% (split among four, not equally—DM and Alan have larger stakes as original visionaries)

**What the money buys:**
- Proper office space (the Central Eastside warehouse)
- First engineering hires (including TenX, Jan 2027)
- Hardware prototypes for AR glasses
- Legal and compliance infrastructure
- Meri's reduced clinic hours (buying out her Thursdays)

---

### Series A (July 2027)
**Amount:** $14M
**Lead:** Castellan Partners (defense-adjacent dual-use technology fund)
**Participants:**
- Mindful Capital (healthcare/mental health focused VC) — $3M
- The Angel (pro-rata follow-on) — $1M

The Series A happens after beta testing shows promise—before the dependency issues become undeniable, before the government letter arrives. The timing is important: they raise on optimism.

**Terms:**
- Castellan Partners: $10M for 22% equity + board seat
- Mindful Capital: $3M for 7% equity + board seat
- The Angel: maintains position, doesn't dilute
- Portland Venture Group: converts observer seat to full board seat
- Founders diluted to: ~48% combined

**What the money buys:**
- Pearl District office upgrade
- Expanded engineering team (15 → 40 people)
- Manufacturing partnerships for glasses hardware
- Clinical trial infrastructure
- Government relations consulting (Castellan's idea)

---

### The Money After (2028)
No Series B happens. The government contract (negotiated in Chapters 26-29) provides operating capital without further dilution. The Angel is bought out at a loss—they want out before the situation becomes public.

---

## Board of Directors

Eight seats. Four founders, four outside.

### Founder Seats

**1. Dunley Masters (DM) — CEO, Chair**
The only founder with previous board experience (she was on the board of her database company before the acquisition). Runs the meetings. Tries to balance vision against fiduciary duty.

**2. Alan Goodenough — Co-Founder**
On the board because he drew the napkin. Rarely speaks in meetings. When he does, people listen—then ignore him. His abstentions are legendary.

**3. Meridian Vance — CCO, Co-Founder**
The clinical credibility. Pushed for her seat when Mindful Capital came in—they wanted a clinical voice on the board, and Meri insisted it be her, not an outside hire. She's the ethics voice that gets outvoted.

**4. Valentina Roswell — (Observer, non-voting)**
Val refused a board seat. "I need to be able to tell you things are broken without worrying about fiduciary duty." She attends meetings as a non-voting observer. Sees everything. Says little. Takes notes that would terrify lawyers.

---

### Investor Seats

**5. The Angel — Seed Lead**
*See extended profile below.*

**6. Graham Lattimer — Castellan Partners**
Former Army intelligence officer, now partner at a fund that specializes in "dual-use" technology—things that work for both commercial and defense applications. Clean-cut, polite, speaks in complete paragraphs. Never raises his voice.

Castellan led the Series A specifically because they saw virtueOS's government potential. Lattimer is patient. He knows the founders need to arrive at the government pivot themselves—or think they did.

> "Graham never pushed. That was the thing. He'd just ask questions. 'Have you considered enterprise applications?' 'What would responsible government use look like?' He made it feel like our idea. By the time we voted, half the board thought the pivot was DM's suggestion. It wasn't. It was always Graham."
> — Alan's notes

**Chapter 13 vote:** FOR

**7. Priya Sharma — Mindful Capital**
Healthcare-focused VC. Genuinely believed in virtueOS as mental health technology. Came in at Series A because Meri's involvement made it credible—a PMHNP co-founder meant this wasn't just tech bros playing with brains.

She's increasingly uncomfortable as the government interest grows. The dependency data from beta testing concerns her. The pivot vote is a breaking point.

> "Priya called me after the vote. She was crying. She said, 'This isn't what I invested in.' I said, 'I know.' She said, 'Can you stop it?' I said, 'I'm trying.' She stayed on the board. I think she's hoping she can still steer it somewhere good. I think she's wrong, but I understand why she stays."
> — Meri

**Chapter 13 vote:** AGAINST

**8. Garrett Hollis — Portland Venture Group**
Local angel syndicate representative. Former Intel engineer who made money in the 90s and now mentors Portland startups. White-haired, soft-spoken, believes in "Portland values" and keeping tech weird.

He's conflicted about the government pivot. Doesn't love it. But Graham Lattimer's argument about scale and impact sways him. Sometimes you have to grow up.

> "Garrett apologized to me after the vote. He said, 'I think this is the wrong direction, but I think you'll figure it out.' That's the most Portland thing anyone's ever said to me. Passive support for something you disagree with."
> — Alan

**Chapter 13 vote:** FOR (reluctantly)

---

### The Unofficial Seat

**9. Colonel (Ret.) Daniel Rifton — "Independent Director"**
Officially: an independent director brought on for "governance expertise" after the Series A. Recommended by the Angel.

Actually: retired intelligence community, specific agency never confirmed. His "retirement" is recent and possibly notional. He's the Angel's contact—or handler—or something.

Rifton doesn't talk much in board meetings. He asks occasional questions that seem naive but aren't. He's the one who mentions that "the government has expressed interest" before the official letter arrives. No one asks how he knows.

> "Daniel Rifton joined the board in August 2027. The government letter arrived in August 2027. I don't believe in coincidences, and I don't believe he's retired from anything."
> — Val's notes (never shared with board)

**Chapter 13 vote:** FOR

---

## Chapter 13 Vote: The Pivot

**Motion:** Pursue government contract and enterprise applications as primary business focus, with consumer product as secondary.

| Board Member | Vote | Reasoning |
|--------------|------|-----------|
| DM | AGAINST | "We built this to help individuals. Government contracts mean weapons applications." |
| Alan | ABSTAIN | "I can see both sides. I need more time to think." |
| Meri | AGAINST | "I've seen what government mental health programs do. This isn't healing. It's control." |
| The Angel | FOR | "The consumer market will never scale. This is the path to real impact." |
| Graham Lattimer | FOR | "Responsible government use is still use for good. We can set the terms." |
| Priya Sharma | AGAINST | "This isn't the company I invested in. Mental health tech shouldn't be weaponized." |
| Garrett Hollis | FOR | "I don't love it, but the growth argument is sound. We'll keep the ethics." |
| Daniel Rifton | FOR | "The government is already interested. Better to engage than to be acquired." |

**Result:** 4-3, motion passes. Alan's abstention is decisive—he could have created a 4-4 tie.

> "I abstained because I genuinely didn't know. DM was right—this was a betrayal of the original vision. Graham was right—the consumer market wasn't going to scale. I couldn't decide who was more right. So I didn't decide. Meri looked at me after the vote like I'd killed something. Maybe I had. I just couldn't tell which thing."
> — Alan's notes

## The Angel: Extended Profile

### What We Know
- Male (referred to as "he" in documents)
- Wealthy enough to write a $2M check personally
- Not from Portland; flies in for meetings
- Asked uncomfortable questions about "access" and "adaptive behavioral modeling" at the first pitch
- Introduced Daniel Rifton to the board
- Bought out at a loss in Chapter 29 (wants out before things go public)

### What We Don't Know
- Real name (always "the Angel" in Alan's collection—Alan knows his name but doesn't use it)
- Source of wealth
- Exact relationship with Rifton and the government
- Whether he was a plant from the beginning or just opportunistic

### What's Implied
The Angel saw what virtueOS could become before anyone else did. His questions at the first pitch weren't skeptical—they were confirmatory. He was checking that the team had built what he thought they'd built.

He's not government directly. He's adjacent—the kind of person who moves between worlds, who has contacts everywhere, who invests in things that might be useful later. When Operation Philosopher King becomes real, the Angel isn't surprised. He's already positioning.

> "I've never used his name in these documents. That's deliberate. He stopped being a person to me after the vote. He became a role—the Angel who offered us money and salvation and took something we couldn't name in return. Angels aren't always good. That's the thing about the religious imagery. The other angels fell too."
> — Alan

### His Exit
The Angel sells his stake back to the company in March 2028, after the negotiation with the government but before the terms are public. He takes a loss—the company's valuation has dropped given the controversy and the narrowed business focus.

But he doesn't seem upset. He's gotten what he needed: proof of concept, data, connections. The money was never the point.

> "He smiled when he signed the buyout papers. I'd never seen him smile before. DM asked what he was happy about. He said, 'I always knew this would work. I'm glad I got to see it.' Then he left. We never heard from him again. I still don't know what 'this' was. The company? The technology? Something else?"
> — Alan

## Open Questions

1. Does the Angel have a name Alan refuses to use, or is he genuinely anonymous even legally? (Probably has a name; Alan just won't print it)

2. What specifically does Rifton's intelligence background involve? (CIA? NSA? DIA? Deliberately vague?)

3. Does Priya Sharma stay on the board through the end, or does she resign at some point?

4. Are there any board members who join later (post-Series A)?

5. What exactly is Castellan Partners' other portfolio? (Other dual-use investments that might connect thematically?)
